Dialogue: 0,0:00:05.81,0:00:07.44,底部白,,0,0,0,,So, over the course of this series,
Dialogue: 0,0:00:10.20,0:00:12.54,底部白,,0,0,0,, we’ve focused almost exclusively on computers –
Dialogue: 0,0:00:12.54,0:00:12.54,底部白,,0,0,0,,the circuits and algorithms that make them tick.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:12.54,0:00:15.19,底部白,,0,0,0,,Because...this is Crash Course Computer Science.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:15.19,0:00:17.79,底部白,,0,0,0,,But ultimately, computers are tools employed by people.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:17.79,0:00:19.81,底部白,,0,0,0,,And humans are… well… messy.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:19.81,0:00:22.29,底部白,,0,0,0,,We haven’t been designed by human engineers from the ground up

Dialogue: 0,0:00:41.22,0:00:45.48,底部白,,0,0,0,,we need to understand the strengths and weaknesses of both computers and humans.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:45.48,0:00:48.90,底部白,,0,0,0,,And for this reason, when good system designers are creating software,

Dialogue: 0,0:01:02.70,0:01:05.29,底部白,,0,0,0,,No doubt you’ve encountered a physical or computer interface
Dialogue: 0,0:01:05.29,0:01:08.57,底部白,,0,0,0,,that was frustrating to use, impeding your progress.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:08.57,0:01:12.17,底部白,,0,0,0,,Maybe it was so badly designed that you couldn’t figure it out and just gave up.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:12.17,0:01:14.41,底部白,,0,0,0,,That interface had poor usability.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:14.41,0:01:17.59,底部白,,0,0,0,,Usability is the degree to which a human-made artifact – like software
Dialogue: 0,0:01:17.59,0:01:21.50,底部白,,0,0,0,, – can be used to achieve an objective effectively and efficiently.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:21.50,0:01:24.52,底部白,,0,0,0,,To facilitate human work, we need to understand humans 
Dialogue: 0,0:01:24.52,0:01:27.80,底部白,,0,0,0,,- from how they see and think, to how they react and interact.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:27.80,0:01:31.48,底部白,,0,0,0,,For instance, the human visual system has been well studied by Psychologists.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:31.48,0:01:34.56,底部白,,0,0,0,,Like, we know that people are good at ordering intensities of colors.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:34.56,0:01:35.56,底部白,,0,0,0,,Here are three.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:35.56,0:01:38.04,底部白,,0,0,0,,Can you arrange these from lightest to darkest?
Dialogue: 0,0:01:38.04,0:01:40.51,底部白,,0,0,0,,You probably don’t have to think too much about it.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:40.51,0:01:43.33,底部白,,0,0,0,,Because of this innate ability, color intensity is a great choice
Dialogue: 0,0:01:43.33,0:01:45.50,底部白,,0,0,0,, for displaying data with continuous values.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:45.50,0:01:48.57,底部白,,0,0,0,,On the other hand, humans are terrible at ordering colors.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:48.57,0:01:50.63,底部白,,0,0,0,,Here’s another example for you to put in order. 
Dialogue: 0,0:01:50.63,0:01:53.23,底部白,,0,0,0,,is orange before blue, or after blue?
Dialogue: 0,0:01:53.23,0:01:54.25,底部白,,0,0,0,,Where does green go?
Dialogue: 0,0:01:54.25,0:01:57.18,底部白,,0,0,0,,You might be thinking we could order this by wavelength of light,
Dialogue: 0,0:01:57.18,0:01:59.82,底部白,,0,0,0,, like a rainbow, but that’s a lot more to think about.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:59.82,0:02:03.17,底部白,,0,0,0,,Most people are going to be much slower and error-prone at ordering.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:03.17,0:02:05.56,底部白,,0,0,0,,Because of this innate ineptitude of your visual system,
Dialogue: 0,0:02:05.56,0:02:09.81,底部白,,0,0,0,, displaying continuous data using colors can be a disastrous design choice.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:09.81,0:02:14.06,底部白,,0,0,0,,You’ll find yourself constantly referring back to a color legend to compare items.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:14.06,0:02:17.40,底部白,,0,0,0,,However, colors are perfect for when the data is discrete with no ordering,
Dialogue: 0,0:02:17.40,0:02:19.32,底部白,,0,0,0,, like categorical data.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:19.32,0:02:21.49,底部白,,0,0,0,,This might seem obvious, but you’d be amazed at 
Dialogue: 0,0:02:21.49,0:02:23.88,底部白,,0,0,0,,how many interfaces get basic things like this wrong.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:23.88,0:02:27.04,底部白,,0,0,0,,Beyond visual perception, understanding human cognition helps us
Dialogue: 0,0:02:27.04,0:02:30.26,底部白,,0,0,0,, design interfaces that align with how the mind works.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:30.26,0:02:33.80,底部白,,0,0,0,,Like, humans can read, remember and process information more effectively
Dialogue: 0,0:02:33.80,0:02:38.76,底部白,,0,0,0,,when it's chunked–that is, when items are put together into small, meaningful groups.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:38.76,0:02:43.08,底部白,,0,0,0,,Humans can generally juggle seven items, plus-or-minus two, in short-term memory.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:43.08,0:02:46.08,底部白,,0,0,0,,To be conservative, we typically see groupings of five or less.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:46.08,0:02:51.76,底部白,,0,0,0,,That’s why telephone numbers are broken into chunks, like 317, 555, 3897.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:51.76,0:02:55.76,底部白,,0,0,0,,Instead of being ten individual digits that we’d likely forget, it’s three chunks,
Dialogue: 0,0:02:55.76,0:02:56.87,底部白,,0,0,0,,which we can handle better.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:56.87,0:03:00.15,底部白,,0,0,0,,From a computer's standpoint, this needlessly takes more time and space, 
Dialogue: 0,0:03:00.15,0:03:01.92,底部白,,0,0,0,,so it's less efficient.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:01.92,0:03:05.03,底部白,,0,0,0,,But, it’s way more efficient for us humans – a tradeoff we almost 
Dialogue: 0,0:03:05.03,0:03:09.10,底部白,,0,0,0,,always make in our favor, since we’re the ones running the show...for now.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:09.10,0:03:11.42,底部白,,0,0,0,,Chunking has been applied to computer interfaces for things
Dialogue: 0,0:03:11.42,0:03:14.02,底部白,,0,0,0,, like drop-down menu items and menu bars with buttons.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:14.02,0:03:18.06,底部白,,0,0,0,,It’d be more efficient for computers to just pack all those together, edge to edge
Dialogue: 0,0:03:18.06,0:03:20.56,底部白,,0,0,0,,– it’s wasted memory and screen real estate.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:20.56,0:03:23.30,底部白,,0,0,0,,But designing interfaces in this way makes them much easier
Dialogue: 0,0:03:23.30,0:03:25.42,底部白,,0,0,0,, to visually scan, remember and access.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:25.42,0:03:29.60,底部白,,0,0,0,,Another central concept used in interface design is affordances.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:29.60,0:03:32.48,底部白,,0,0,0,,According to Don Norman, who popularized the term in computing,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:32.48,0:03:36.64,底部白,,0,0,0,,"affordances provide strong clues to the operations of things.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:36.64,0:03:37.84,底部白,,0,0,0,,Plates are for pushing.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:37.84,0:03:39.24,底部白,,0,0,0,,Knobs are for turning.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:39.24,0:03:41.40,底部白,,0,0,0,,Slots are for inserting things into.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:41.40,0:03:45.94,底部白,,0,0,0,,[...] When affordances are taken advantage of, the user knows what to do just by looking:
Dialogue: 0,0:03:45.94,0:03:48.45,底部白,,0,0,0,,no picture, label, or instruction needed.”
Dialogue: 0,0:03:48.45,0:03:52.38,底部白,,0,0,0,,If you’ve ever tried to pull a door handle, only to realize that you have to push it open,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:52.38,0:03:54.31,底部白,,0,0,0,,you’ve discovered a broken affordance.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:54.31,0:03:56.13,底部白,,0,0,0,,On the other hand, a door plate is a better design
Dialogue: 0,0:03:56.13,0:03:58.44,底部白,,0,0,0,, because it only gives you the option to push.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:58.44,0:04:01.98,底部白,,0,0,0,,Doors are pretty straightforward – if you need to put written instructions on them,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:01.98,0:04:03.72,底部白,,0,0,0,,you should probably go back to the drawing board.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:03.72,0:04:06.76,底部白,,0,0,0,,Affordances are used extensively in graphical user interfaces,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:06.76,0:04:09.18,底部白,,0,0,0,, which we discussed in episode 26.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:09.18,0:04:13.67,底部白,,0,0,0,,It’s one of the reasons why computers became so much easier to use than with command lines.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:13.67,0:04:18.02,底部白,,0,0,0,,You don’t have to guess what things on-screen are clickable, because they look like buttons.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:18.02,0:04:20.20,底部白,,0,0,0,,They pop out, just waiting for you to press them!
Dialogue: 0,0:04:20.20,0:04:24.91,底部白,,0,0,0,,One of my favorite affordances, which suggests to users that an on-screen element is draggable,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:24.91,0:04:27.49,底部白,,0,0,0,,is knurling – that texture added to objects
Dialogue: 0,0:04:27.49,0:04:30.29,底部白,,0,0,0,, to improve grip and show you where to best grab them.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:30.29,0:04:33.28,底部白,,0,0,0,,This idea and pattern was borrowed from real world physical tools.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:33.28,0:04:38.09,底部白,,0,0,0,,Related to the concept of affordances is the psychology of recognition vs recall.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:38.09,0:04:39.59,底部白,,0,0,0,,You know this effect well from tests – 
Dialogue: 0,0:04:39.59,0:04:43.46,底部白,,0,0,0,,it's why multiple choice questions are easier than fill-in-the-blank ones.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:43.46,0:04:46.84,底部白,,0,0,0,,In general, human memory is much better when it’s triggered by a sensory cue,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:46.84,0:04:48.78,底部白,,0,0,0,,like a word, picture or sound.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:48.78,0:04:52.60,底部白,,0,0,0,,That’s why interfaces use icons – pictorial representations of functions
Dialogue: 0,0:04:52.60,0:04:55.60,底部白,,0,0,0,, – like a trash can for where files go to be deleted.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:55.60,0:04:59.72,底部白,,0,0,0,,We don’t have to recall what that icon does, we just have to recognise the icon.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:59.72,0:05:02.49,底部白,,0,0,0,,This was also a huge improvement over command line interfaces,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:02.49,0:05:05.80,底部白,,0,0,0,, where you had to rely on your memory for what commands to use.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:05.80,0:05:10.66,底部白,,0,0,0,,Do I have to type “delete”, or “remove”, or... “trash”, or… shoot, it could be anything!
Dialogue: 0,0:05:10.66,0:05:11.79,底部白,,0,0,0,,It’s actually “rm” in linux,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:11.79,0:05:16.17,底部白,,0,0,0,, but anyway, making everything easy to discover and learn sometimes means slow to access, 
Dialogue: 0,0:05:16.17,0:05:19.59,底部白,,0,0,0,,which conflicts with another psychology concept: expertise.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:19.59,0:05:22.34,底部白,,0,0,0,,As you gain experience with interfaces, you get faster,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:22.34,0:05:25.14,底部白,,0,0,0,, building mental models of how to do things efficiently.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:25.14,0:05:28.63,底部白,,0,0,0,,So, good interfaces should offer multiple paths to accomplish goals.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:28.63,0:05:32.57,底部白,,0,0,0,,A great example of this is copy and paste, which can be found in the edit dropdown menu
Dialogue: 0,0:05:32.57,0:05:36.56,底部白,,0,0,0,,of word processors, and is also triggered with keyboard shortcuts.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:36.56,0:05:41.08,底部白,,0,0,0,,One approach caters to novices, while the other caters to experts, slowing down neither.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:41.08,0:05:43.82,底部白,,0,0,0,,So, you can have your cake and eat it too!
Dialogue: 0,0:05:43.82,0:05:45.57,底部白,,0,0,0,,In addition to making humans more efficient,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:45.57,0:05:48.66,底部白,,0,0,0,,we'd also like computers to be emotionally intelligent – 
Dialogue: 0,0:05:48.66,0:05:51.16,底部白,,0,0,0,,adapting their behavior to respond appropriately
Dialogue: 0,0:05:51.16,0:05:54.61,底部白,,0,0,0,, to their users' emotional state – also called affect.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:54.61,0:05:58.41,底部白,,0,0,0,,That could make experiences more empathetic, enjoyable, or even delightful.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:58.41,0:06:03.63,底部白,,0,0,0,,This vision was articulated by Rosalind Picard in her 1995 paper on Affective Computing,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:03.63,0:06:06.80,底部白,,0,0,0,,which kickstarted an interdisciplinary field combining aspects

Dialogue: 0,0:06:14.93,0:06:18.94,底部白,,0,0,0,,This was a huge deal, because we know emotion influences cognition and perception

Dialogue: 0,0:06:23.07,0:06:26.93,底部白,,0,0,0,,Affect-aware systems use sensors, sometimes worn, that capture things like speech and
