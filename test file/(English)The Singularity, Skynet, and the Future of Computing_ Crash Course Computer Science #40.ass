Dialogue: 0,0:03:14.35,0:03:18.65,Default,,0,0,0,,What really gets people thinking, and sometimes sweating, is whether Artificial Intelligence

Dialogue: 0,0:03:20.70,0:03:24.96,Default,,0,0,0,,This is a really tricky question for a multitude of reasons, including most immediately:

Dialogue: 0,0:03:37.82,0:03:42.28,Default,,0,0,0,,But on the other hand, computers fail at some basic tasks, like walking up steps, folding

Dialogue: 0,0:03:46.42,0:03:51.68,Default,,0,0,0,,We’re a long way from Artificial Intelligence that’s as general purpose and capable as a human.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:51.68,0:03:56.10,Default,,0,0,0,,With intelligence being somewhat hard to quantify, people prefer to characterize computers and

Dialogue: 0,0:04:23.21,0:04:27.19,Default,,0,0,0,,That sounds like a big gap, but with the rate of change in computing technologies, we might

Dialogue: 0,0:05:44.96,0:05:49.70,Default,,0,0,0,,There are people who eagerly await it, and those who are already working to stop it from happening.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:49.70,0:05:53.82,Default,,0,0,0,,Probably the most immediate effect would be technological unemployment, where workers
