2
00:00:11,544 --> 00:00:12,682
Hello?

3
00:00:12,746 --> 00:00:14,419
Oh, my...

4
00:00:14,481 --> 00:00:16,688
It smells like this room
has not been cleaned

5
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:19,287
for five whole seasons...

6
00:00:19,352 --> 00:00:22,231
of a television show.

7
00:00:26,126 --> 00:00:29,801
Oh! Hello chicken!
Ooh, your chair so dirty.

8
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:33,242
If I clean you no run
away, okay?

9
00:00:34,601 --> 00:00:36,103
You promise?

10
00:00:51,418 --> 00:00:54,386
I like you, Chicken.

11
00:01:13,273 --> 00:01:15,307
Oh man! I just realized
they'll probably show

12
00:01:15,308 --> 00:01:17,543
the Sex and the City <i>3</i> trailer!

13
00:01:17,544 --> 00:01:18,818
Why are you so excited?

14
00:01:18,878 --> 00:01:20,323
I tried to drag you
to the last one

15
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:21,518
and you almost
broke up with me.

16
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:22,924
The last one flopped pretty bad,

17
00:01:22,982 --> 00:01:24,290
so the studio's
making the third one

18
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:28,628
more guy-friendly.

19
00:01:28,688 --> 00:01:31,294
Well, the lack of testes
was making me testy

20
00:01:31,357 --> 00:01:35,134
but this boring event just took
a sperm for the better.

21
00:01:37,997 --> 00:01:40,341
Hey everyone, this chick is
giving me some...

22
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,378
ah you know what,
it's too easy.

23
00:01:41,434 --> 00:01:42,879
Joke withdrawn, everyone.
Joke withdrawn.

24
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:45,473
"The detective said Samantha's
collar was rigged to blow

25
00:01:45,538 --> 00:01:47,211
as soon as she made a sex pun.

26
00:01:47,273 --> 00:01:49,583
So it couldn't have been on her
for more than 60 seconds."

27
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:53,720
Carrie, come
to Miranda's, quick!

28
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:56,522
The collar was rigged to blow as
soon as she tasted tuna.

29
00:01:56,583 --> 00:01:59,462
Ironically, she was making
an actual tuna fish sandwich.

30
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:02,125
Mr. Big, someone
is killing my friends!

31
00:02:02,188 --> 00:02:03,531
You've got to help us!

32
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:04,898
Carrie, I have two secrets.

33
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:07,564
First, my real name isn't
Alexander Big.

34
00:02:07,627 --> 00:02:09,573
My second secret...

35
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:11,836
is THIS.

36
00:02:11,898 --> 00:02:14,708
Out of the way gaybies!

37
00:02:14,767 --> 00:02:17,304
Hyah! Hyah!

38
00:02:29,015 --> 00:02:31,586
Big? I feel so strange.

39
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:34,996
Your brain is getting used to
your new body, Miss Bradshaw.

40
00:02:38,057 --> 00:02:43,939
Uhh, what shall I do
with her old body?

41
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:46,841
Donate it to science.

44
00:02:58,111 --> 00:03:00,387
Shut up! The Katherine Heigl
movie is starting.

45
00:03:02,815 --> 00:03:04,522
<i>Sex and The City 3!</i>

46
00:03:04,584 --> 00:03:05,585
<i>Sex and The City 3!</i>

47
00:03:05,652 --> 00:03:07,359
Shhh!!

48
00:03:10,924 --> 00:03:14,633
Hey hey hey! I avoid starvation
for another day!

49
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:16,173
Sorry Yogi,

50
00:03:16,229 --> 00:03:18,971
but if you steal
one more basket, it's my job.

51
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:22,172
You'll never catch me, I live
the life of the free!

52
00:03:22,235 --> 00:03:24,408
Not this time, Yogi.

53
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:27,383
Ho Chi Hacharu!

54
00:03:38,284 --> 00:03:42,027
Quite the surprise, but try
this one on for size!

55
00:03:45,091 --> 00:03:47,037
Hey, hey, hey!

61
00:04:15,521 --> 00:04:18,092
What the fuck is happening!!

62
00:04:20,126 --> 00:04:23,428
And that is how you bring
Yogi Bear to Japan!

63
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:26,171
You're welcome!

64
00:04:33,172 --> 00:04:36,244
They called me mad,
but I did it!

65
00:04:36,309 --> 00:04:38,482
Egypt shall forevermore be known

66
00:04:38,544 --> 00:04:42,492
as the land of giant boobies!

67
00:04:52,992 --> 00:04:55,302
Haha. They're like giant
boobies!

68
00:04:55,361 --> 00:04:57,671
Don't be an idiot!

69
00:04:57,730 --> 00:04:59,141
I just don't think
we're ready for this.

70
00:04:59,198 --> 00:05:00,832
Not-not right now.

71
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:04,804
Okay.
I understand. It's okay.

72
00:06:27,253 --> 00:06:30,700
Are you on your way
to a fancy party?!

73
00:06:30,757 --> 00:06:34,398
That was my line from our first
appearance on this show.

74
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:35,302
Eyegorp!

75
00:06:38,664 --> 00:06:40,837
I deserve it!

76
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:46,550
Oh, man.

77
00:06:52,311 --> 00:06:54,450
You seem so RUTHLESS...

78
00:06:54,514 --> 00:06:57,757
time to make you TOOTHLESS!

79
00:07:17,804 --> 00:07:19,477
Mmm, your beak looks ribbed...

80
00:07:19,539 --> 00:07:22,019
for MY pleasure!

81
00:07:22,074 --> 00:07:23,052
Oh! Ow!

82
00:07:25,311 --> 00:07:29,054
That's not half bad actually.

83
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:31,652
I'm so happy
'cause you are gonna die

84
00:07:31,717 --> 00:07:34,323
GONNA DIE!

85
00:07:38,891 --> 00:07:41,667
No no no!
No, stop!

86
00:07:49,769 --> 00:07:51,942
A drumroll?
It's so suspenseful!

87
00:07:52,004 --> 00:07:54,006
AAAAAAAAAAA!!

88
00:07:54,073 --> 00:07:56,053
What an ironic death!

89
00:07:56,108 --> 00:07:58,577
I'm a CHAMPION!

90
00:07:58,578 --> 00:08:00,580
Looks like SOMEONE'S
been watching

91
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:02,353
Tony Jaa's The Protector.

92
00:08:02,415 --> 00:08:04,326
L-Looks like someone
just peed

93
00:08:04,383 --> 00:08:06,385
in his Gatchaman boxer shorts!

94
00:08:18,397 --> 00:08:20,001
Whew.

95
00:08:22,702 --> 00:08:25,512
Suck my sleigh balls!

96
00:08:25,571 --> 00:08:28,814
Argh!
My only weakness!

97
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:34,386
Duh da da da dah dah daaaah!

98
00:08:34,447 --> 00:08:36,290
Bitch. Pudding!

99
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:37,623
B-b-b-blam!

100
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:40,289
How do you like this taste
of Bitch Pudding?!

101
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:41,889
Your momma sure liked it
when she ate it

102
00:08:41,954 --> 00:08:43,058
out of my butthole!

103
00:08:45,258 --> 00:08:47,431
B-Blam! Bitch Pudding!

104
00:08:47,493 --> 00:08:49,166
Blam blam blam blam blam!
Whoooo! Blam!

105
00:08:51,664 --> 00:08:54,736
Blaaaaamm... Ow!

106
00:08:59,438 --> 00:09:00,917
You saved me!
- Have at thee!

107
00:09:00,973 --> 00:09:02,975
My life has value after all!

108
00:09:06,746 --> 00:09:08,419
Ding dang!

109
00:09:08,481 --> 00:09:12,258
This is gonna be one
dilly of a slobberknocker!

110
00:09:12,318 --> 00:09:15,925
These ratings will be glorious.

111
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:24,371
Let me just get that for you.

112
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:26,341
I wish I was a bionic chicken.

113
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:30,814
That would be so cool.

114
