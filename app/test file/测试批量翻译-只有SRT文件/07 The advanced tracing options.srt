1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:01,040
- [Voiceover] In this movie,

2
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:03,040
we'll take a look at the Advanced Tracing options.

3
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:05,080
Which again, are made available to us

4
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:07,090
inside the Image Trace panel.

5
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:09,080
So, I'll start things off by clicking

6
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:12,020
on the line art in order to select it.

7
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:13,040
And then I'll click on the triangle

8
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:14,080
in front of the word, advanced

9
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,060
or the bottom of the image trace panel,

10
00:00:16,060 --> 00:00:20,010
in order to expand these many additional options.

11
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:23,040
I'm gonna go ahead and zoom in on these details

12
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:24,070
in front of the pencil.

13
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:27,050
Which are intended to indicate flecks of graphite.

14
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:28,040
And we're gonna start things off

15
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:30,070
with this Noise option right here.

16
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:32,090
If your image is noisy, that is it contains

17
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:34,070
a bunch of random flecks,

18
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:39,000
then you can crank this value up to ignore smaller details.

19
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,030
And at 71 pixels, we're saying that anything

20
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:45,020
that is smaller than 71 pixels will not get traced

21
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:46,010
And as a result,

22
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:48,070
I lost a lot of those little bits of graphite.

23
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:50,030
And I also lost the interior

24
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:53,010
of the A, the O and the R.

25
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:54,060
Which, of course, is not what I want.

26
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:57,090
And that's because this image is a very clean image.

27
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:59,060
It's low noise, and that's largely a function

28
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:04,010
of cleaning your scanner glass before you scan your artwork.

29
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:05,010
And that way you don't have a bunch

30
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:07,010
of dust and junk all over the place.

31
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:10,060
And so I'm gonna take this noise value down to five pixels.

32
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:13,030
And press the Enter key, or Return key on the Mac,

33
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:15,060
in order to apply that change.

34
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:17,080
After which point we'll see more flecks of graphite,

35
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:20,060
and we'll see the interiors of those letters.

36
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:22,060
Next we have this corners value here,

37
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:25,050
and it decides the weighting between smooth points

38
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:28,050
and corner points inside the traced artwork.

39
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:31,020
And so let's say, I'm not really liking

40
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:34,040
all the little corners on the graphite once again

41
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:35,080
and throughout the rest of the art.

42
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:38,010
Then I can go ahead and crank that value

43
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:40,040
down to something like 10 percent,

44
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:42,060
and that's gonna give me a lot fewer corners

45
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:44,010
than I had before.

46
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:47,020
And so of course, if you take it down to zero percent,

47
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:49,040
you're pretty much not going to have any corners at all.

48
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,050
But at 10, we have much smoother results.

49
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:56,090
Paths, is gonna determine the fidelity of the line art.

50
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:57,090
How many paths are used.

51
00:01:57,090 --> 00:01:59,080
Notice down here at the bottom of the panel,

52
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:02,080
we can see that we have 3,473 paths

53
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:06,090
and a little more than 39,000 anchor points.

54
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:09,050
If I want better fidelity, I would just go ahead

55
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:12,050
and crank that Paths value up to 100 percent,

56
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:15,060
which is gonna give me a lot more complexity.

57
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:18,050
You can see we have almost 2,000 more paths,

58
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:21,090
but our anchor paths have shot up to 103,000.

59
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:25,060
And we've got some very wiggly looking line art right here,

60
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:28,010
which has a high fidelity factor.

61
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:31,030
But is possibly a little less smooth than I'd like,

62
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:34,050
which is why I ultimately came up with a value here.

63
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:37,020
A Paths value of 94 percent, which is gonna help

64
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:39,070
to smooth out the artwork dramatically,

65
00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:42,080
and it basically cut the number of anchor points in half.

66
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,020
Alright, now notice Snap Curves To Lines,

67
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:46,060
that check box right there.

68
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:48,040
What that's gonna do is it's gonna take

69
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:52,040
slightly curving lines and it's gonna make them straight.

70
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,070
Now it doesn't make too much difference

71
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:55,040
where this artwork is concerned.

72
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:58,010
Notice I went ahead and turned the checkbox off.

73
00:02:58,010 --> 00:03:01,030
But it may make a difference with schematic artwork.

74
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:03,020
So if you have a lot of rulered lines,

75
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:05,020
that is lines that you do with a straightedge.

76
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:06,080
Then you would probably want to leave

77
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,050
that checkbox turned on.

78
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:12,030
Also notice right here the number of colors is set to two.

79
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:14,030
And that's because Illustrator is tracing

80
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:15,090
both the black line art

81
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:18,010
and the white stuff in the background.

82
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:19,040
I don't want that, so I'm gonna turn on

83
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,070
the Ignore White checkbox.

84
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:23,080
And that's gonna reduce the number of colors,

85
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:27,040
as you'll see in just a moment here, to one.

86
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,030
Alright, we also have this Create option,

87
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:32,030
which will either create filled-path outlines

88
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:33,090
as we're doing right now.

89
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:37,010
Or you can create stroked paths in addition or instead.

90
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:38,040
And for now, I'm gonna leave that off

91
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:41,060
because that really slows things down, but I will show you

92
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:43,090
what that looks like in a future movie.

93
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:46,020
And then finally, we've got this Method option.

94
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:47,080
Which allows Illustrator to create

95
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:50,010
overlapping path outlines.

96
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:52,080
And while you may get slightly better results out of that,

97
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:56,030
that's gonna kick the number of colors back up to two

98
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:57,090
because Illustrator is going to trace

99
00:03:57,090 --> 00:04:00,090
both black and white path outlines.

100
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:04,050
And notice now that the Ignore White checkbox is now dimmed.

101
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:05,050
Which is why I'm gonna go ahead

102
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:08,080
and press Crtl + z, or Command + z on the Mac,

103
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,080
to undo that change.

104
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:11,030
Because I really, for this art,

105
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:14,040
only wanna trace the black paths.

106
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,090
Alright so that pretty much takes care

107
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:19,080
of everything we have control of during a tracing process

108
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:21,090
Which is why if you're satisfied with your results,

109
00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:24,070
you probably wanna go ahead and save a custom preset.

110
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:26,070
By clicking on this little fly up menu

111
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:28,030
toward the top of the panel

112
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:30,030
and then choosing, Save as New Preset.

113
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:32,070
And now I'm just gonna go ahead and call

114
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:35,050
this guy Freeform ink art and click OK.

115
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:36,080
After which point, you will now see it

116
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:39,060
not only available in this pop-up menu,

117
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:42,030
but it will be available the next time you create a tracing

118
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:44,090
up here in the control panel.

119
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:47,070
Alright, I'm gonna go ahead and press Crtl + 0.

120
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:50,010
Or Command + 0 on the Mac, to zoom out.

121
00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:51,050
And I'll click off the artwork as well

122
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:53,040
and hide the Image Trace panel.

123
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,060
And now I'm gonna twirl open this tracing layer

124
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:57,050
so we can see the difference here.

125
00:04:57,050 --> 00:05:00,090
I'll go ahead and turn on the 300 ppi tracing,

126
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:04,010
and I'll turn off the 600 ppi for a moment.

127
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:06,030
That was Illustrator's default attempt

128
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:09,060
at tracing the medium-resolution artwork.

129
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:11,030
And this is the much better, custom,

130
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:13,040
higher-resolution resolution tracing.

131
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:16,020
Thanks to our ability to finesse the tracing process

132
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:19,040
using the advanced Image Trace panel controls

133
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:21,040
here inside Illustrator.

134
01:59:58,000 --> 01:59:59:000
