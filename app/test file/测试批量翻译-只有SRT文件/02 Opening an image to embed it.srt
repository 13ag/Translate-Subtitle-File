1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,070
- [Voiceover] Alright there's two ways to bring

2
00:00:01,070 --> 00:00:03,040
pixel based images into Illustrator.

3
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:04,070
One is the open command,

4
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:06,040
which we'll be looking at in this movie,

5
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:08,000
and the other is the place command,

6
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,040
which I'll show you in the next movie.

7
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:12,060
So, here I am looking at a scanned image

8
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:15,010
inside Photoshop, by the way.

9
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:16,040
Just so we can inspect it.

10
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:19,080
And I drew this cartoon just years and years and years ago

11
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:23,030
using a rapidograph filled with black ink

12
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:25,090
on a piece of white bond paper.

13
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:28,030
So the original piece of artwork looks absolutely black

14
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:30,000
against a white background.

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,090
But I scanned it using a consumer grade office scanner,

16
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:35,040
so it's looking gray on gray.

17
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,050
And if we were to expect the image a little bit,

18
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:39,050
you will see a few things wrong with it.

19
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:42,020
Notice that we've got some gunk right here

20
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:44,000
that must have been on the scanner glass.

21
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,020
We've got color artifacting

22
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:49,020
these purple edges and green edges around the lines.

23
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:52,020
And then if you scroll down here to the bottom,

24
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:54,070
you'll see that we have a water stain.

25
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:57,070
You can see the edge of the paper, and so forth.

26
00:00:57,070 --> 00:01:00,000
But the good news is that Illustrator is capable

27
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,090
of filtering out all of this extra information

28
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:05,090
so that we can hone in just on the line art.

29
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:08,030
Alright so I'll go ahead and switch over to Illustrator

30
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:11,060
and because nothing's open, I'm seeing the start screen.

31
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:13,030
I'm not a big fan of this screen

32
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:16,030
and if you aren't either, and you wanna turn it off,

33
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:18,070
then you can press control k here on a PC,

34
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:20,020
or command k on a Mac

35
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:23,010
to bring up the general pane of the preferences dialogue box

36
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:25,000
and then just go ahead and turn off

37
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,040
this check box right there show start workspace

38
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,010
when no documents are open, and click okay.

39
00:01:30,010 --> 00:01:32,000
And all that stuff will go away.

40
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Alright so method number one

41
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,010
for getting the image into Illustrator

42
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:39,010
is to go up to the file menu and choose the open command.

43
00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:41,000
Or of course you have that keyboard shortcut

44
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,020
of control o, or command o on the Mac.

45
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:45,080
And then I'll just go ahead and locate that scanned image,

46
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:49,000
and click the open button in order to open it

47
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,090
inside of a new illustration.

48
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:53,070
And I notice the art board is a little bit larger

49
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:55,020
than the image itself.

50
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:56,090
It could end up being smaller.

51
00:01:56,090 --> 00:02:00,080
It's just a function of the fact that this is an RGB image,

52
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:03,090
and so Illustrator went ahead and put it inside

53
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:06,090
of a default basic RGB document.

54
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:09,070
If you want the art board to be the same size as the image,

55
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:11,070
then go ahead and click on it to select it.

56
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:13,060
Make sure under the view menu

57
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:15,040
that your smart guides are turned on.

58
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,060
And then, switch to the art board tool,

59
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:19,060
which you can get by pressing shift o,

60
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:21,080
and I'll go ahead and press control zero,

61
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:24,030
or command zero on the Mac, to zoom out just a little bit

62
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:26,040
and I'll drag the upper left corner of the art board

63
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:28,060
until it snaps into alignment with the image,

64
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:30,030
and then I'll do the same thing

65
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:32,020
with the bottom left corner of the art board,

66
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:34,000
and then I'll press the escape key

67
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,080
in order to return control to the black arrow tool.

68
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,010
Alright I'll also go ahead and press control zero,

69
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:40,080
or command zero on a Mac, to zoom in.

70
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,030
Now notice the image is still selected,

71
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:45,070
and Illustrator is identifying it over here

72
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:48,090
on the far left side of the control panel as an image.

73
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:51,030
And if you like you can click on the word image

74
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:52,090
to see the file name.

75
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:54,090
You'll also have the file name listed right here,

76
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:56,060
and notice it's telling me the entire path

77
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:59,010
so it's aware that at one time,

78
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:02,040
this is the file that I placed inside the document.

79
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:05,070
The thing is, there's no link between that file

80
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:08,040
and this document as things stand now,

81
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:11,020
and that's because Illustrator has gone ahead

82
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:12,070
and embedded the image.

83
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:15,060
The image is actually part of the document.

84
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:18,050
And so for example, if I was to switch back to Photoshop,

85
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:21,050
go up to the image menu, choose image rotation,

86
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:24,050
and choose flip canvas horizontal,

87
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:27,000
in order to flip the image horizontally like so.

88
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,090
And I'll even go up to the file menu and overwrite

89
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:32,040
the original file by choosing the save command.

90
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:35,000
Then, when I switch back over to Illustrator,

91
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,040
nothing happens.

92
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:40,010
And that's because there is no link to that file on disk.

93
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:44,000
Again what we have instead is an embedded image.

94
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,090
If you wanted to unembed it,

95
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:48,020
you can click on this unembed button right there.

96
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:51,080
In order to save this image either as a layered PSD,

97
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:53,070
which is a native Photoshop document,

98
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:56,060
or as a TIFF image, either one.

99
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:58,000
But that's gonna go ahead and create

100
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,070
a new version of this image,

101
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:03,020
and establish a link to that image file instead.

102
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:05,020
That's not what I wanna do, however,

103
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:07,010
so I'll just go ahead and cancel out.

104
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:09,090
Alright now while this is an easy way to work,

105
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:11,090
because it just requires the open command,

106
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:14,000
and it's a totally acceptable way to work.

107
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,040
We could now trace this image

108
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,010
by clicking on the image face button

109
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:18,060
up here in the control panel.

110
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:21,050
The problem is Illustrator isn't terribly efficient

111
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:23,050
at dealing with embedded images.

112
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:26,050
And as a result, you get large files.

113
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:28,080
So for example, this file is gonna weigh in

114
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,050
at about seven megabytes.

115
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:33,050
Which isn't horrible, but we can get a much smaller file

116
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:37,010
and we can create a link to the image file on disk

117
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:39,000
using the place command.

118
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,000
And I'll show you how that works in the very next movie.
