00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:01,090
- [Voiceover] In this movie I'll show you how

2
00:00:01,090 --> 00:00:05,010
to expand and simplify your auto traced artwork,

3
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:08,030
so that you can access the path outlines directly using

4
00:00:08,030 --> 00:00:10,050
Black and White Arrow tools.

5
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:13,040
And so, for example, where this artwork is concerned

6
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:15,020
Illustrator has gone ahead and traced

7
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:17,050
the top edge of the paper.

8
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:21,080
And we also have a single little piece of dust

9
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:24,020
right over here that I'd like to get rid of.

10
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:26,010
And that's the point at which you just go ahead

11
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:28,020
and expand your artwork so you can modify

12
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:30,030
the path outlines directly.

13
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:32,060
And so I'm going to go ahead and zoom back out here.

14
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:34,030
And I'm going to create a new layer

15
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:36,070
by dropping down to the little page icon

16
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:38,030
at the bottom of the layers panel,

17
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:40,040
and Alt or Option clicking on it.

18
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:43,040
That forces the display of the layer options dialog box.

19
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,070
At which point I'll go ahead and call this guy

20
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:48,020
"Expanded Paths" let's say.

21
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:50,030
And then I'll click OK.

22
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:52,080
Alright, now I wanna copy the 600 ppi

23
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:54,010
version of the artwork.

24
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:56,060
So I'll click on this little circle to select

25
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:58,070
it right there, and then I'll press the Alt

26
00:00:58,070 --> 00:01:00,090
key or the Option key on the Mac;

27
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:03,020
and drag either of these blue squares

28
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:05,090
and drop it onto the new layer.

29
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:07,080
And because the Alt or Option key is down,

30
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:10,040
that goes ahead and duplicates the artwork

31
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:11,090
as opposed to moving it.

32
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:13,070
Alright, now I'll go ahead and collapse

33
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:15,090
the tracing layer and turn off it's eye

34
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:18,010
so that it's no longer visible.

35
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:20,030
And then I'll go up to this Expand button,

36
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:21,060
up here in the control panel,

37
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:23,000
and click on it.

38
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,050
Essentially anytime you see the word "Expand"

39
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:28,010
inside Illustrator that's going to convert

40
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:31,050
this special object to static path outlines.

41
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:33,050
And sure enough, in our case, we end up

42
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:36,040
with this group; and we can tell it's a group

43
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:38,040
because we're seeing the word "Group"

44
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:40,090
over here on the far left side of the control panel.

45
00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:43,010
But I want to gain direct access to all the paths,

46
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:45,090
so I'll go up to the object menu and choose the "Ungroup"

47
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:48,050
command, or you can press Control + Shift + G,

48
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:50,030
or Command + Shift + G on the Mac.

49
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:51,080
And now I'm going to go ahead

50
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:54,070
and zoom in here on this top junk.

51
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:56,080
And I know I want to get rid of this little guy,

52
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:59,020
so I'll go marquee it with the Black Arrow tool.

53
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:00,070
And then press the Backspace key,

54
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:03,000
or the Delete key on the Mac to get rid of it.

55
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,080
And then I'll just marquee this garbage up here at the top,

56
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:09,000
and I'll again press the Backspace or Delete key.

57
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,080
Alright now let's say you want to simplify

58
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,050
the path outlines a little bit,

59
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:15,070
Illustrator offers a feature that does exactly that.

60
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:18,000
And so the first thing I'll do is press Control + A

61
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,030
or Command + A on the Mac in order to select

62
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:22,010
all the path outlines.

63
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:24,050
And then I'll press Control + H or Command + H

64
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:26,050
on the Mac to hide those anchor points

65
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:28,050
so we can better see what we're doing.

66
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:31,000
And now you want to go up to the Object menu,

67
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
choose Path, and choose Simplify.

68
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,050
Now by default, Illustrator goes a little bit

69
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:39,000
too far, and we can see that by turning on the

70
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,030
preview checkbox...

71
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:43,010
(speaker chuckles)

72
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:45,040
And that just looks absolutely ridiculous.

73
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,010
The good news is we've dropped

74
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:51,000
from 29,000 anchor points to just 4600.

75
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,070
But of course the bad news is,

76
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:56,050
that our artwork is absolutely unidentifiable.

77
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:58,030
So, we have a couple of options here.

78
00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:00,060
We've got the angle threshold that determines

79
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:02,060
the maximum angle of our corners.

80
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:04,090
And so notice that as you crack that value up,

81
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:08,020
you typically get better and better results.

82
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:10,060
And so, I could take it all the way up to 180.

83
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:12,030
But then we're not really dropping

84
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:14,040
too many anchor points here.

85
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:16,040
Which is why I ultimately took it down to

86
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:19,040
150 degrees like so.

87
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,040
And then what you typically want to do

88
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,050
is crank the curve precision value

89
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:28,040
all the way up to 100%. And that still is going to give us

90
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:30,020
fewer anchor points than we had before.

91
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:33,000
Notice that we've dropped about 9000 anchor points.

92
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,050
And then I just go ahead and press the Down

93
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:38,020
Arrow key while this value is active

94
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:40,090
'til I'm no longer comfortable with the results

95
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:42,050
that I'm seeing onscreen.

96
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:45,000
Which happens at about 97%;

97
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,010
things start to shift a little bit too much.

98
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:48,070
Which is why I went ahead took this

99
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:51,020
value back up to 98%.

100
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:53,050
And notice we've still got way fewer points,

101
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:56,050
about half as many anchor points as we had before.

102
00:03:56,050 --> 00:03:58,010
Which means that this document

103
00:03:58,010 --> 00:04:01,060
is going to be a lot easier to export and to print.

104
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:04,000
And now I'll just go ahead and click OK

105
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,080
in order to except those results.

106
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:08,070
And just so we can see the difference nice and close here,

107
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:10,050
I'll go ahead and press Control + Z

108
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:12,000
or Command + Z on the Mac.

109
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,060
These are the unsimplified paths.

110
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:16,050
And then if I press Control + Shift + Z,

111
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:18,020
or Command + Shift + Z on the Mac

112
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:20,000
to redo that simplification,

113
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,070
we see those simplified path outlines

114
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:25,050
with only about half as many anchor points

115
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:29,030
doing some really great work inside this illustration.

116
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:31,080
Alright and just because Control + H or Command + H,

117
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:34,010
that keyboard shortcut that hides the anchor points,

118
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:36,020
because it's sticky, it's actually saved

119
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:37,090
as a state in your document.

120
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:39,070
I'll go ahead and press Control + H

121
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:41,010
or Command + H on the Mac

122
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:43,000
in order to bring back those anchor points

123
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,020
and I'll click off the illustration to deselect it.

124
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:48,050
And that friends, is how you expand

125
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:51,010
and simplify your auto traced artwork

126
00:04:51,010 --> 00:04:53,010
here inside Illustrator.
