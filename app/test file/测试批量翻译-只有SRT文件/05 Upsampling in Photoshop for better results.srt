00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:02,010
- [Voiceover] In this movie, I'll show you

2
00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:04,000
how you can get still better results

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,010
out of Illustrator's auto-tracing feature,

4
00:00:06,010 --> 00:00:09,050
by first upsampling the image to a higher resolution

5
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:11,050
inside Photoshop.

6
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:13,070
So I'm going to start by switching from Illustrator

7
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:16,070
to Photoshop, and then I'll go up to the image menu

8
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:19,040
and choose the Image Size command.

9
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:22,010
Now one of the great things about this dialog box these days

10
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:25,010
is that it's scalable, so I'm going to make it take up

11
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:29,040
the entire screen and that way I can see a big preview

12
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:31,000
of my image as I work on it.

13
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,030
Now, notice over here we're seeing a resolution value

14
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:35,020
of 300 pixels per inch.

15
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:37,090
Ideally, if I wanted a higher resolution,

16
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:40,070
I would have scanned the image at a higher resolution

17
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:42,010
in the first place.

18
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:44,090
Unfortunately, the scanner I used, as I was saying,

19
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:47,070
it's just a consumer-grade office scanner, tops out

20
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:49,080
at 300 pixels per inch.

21
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:52,030
You just can't get any more fidelity out of it.

22
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:56,090
Fortunately, Photoshop CC is very good at upsampling

23
00:00:56,090 --> 00:01:00,020
these days, and so to add pixels to an image,

24
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:02,010
you turn on the resample checkbox,

25
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:05,020
go ahead and make sure the setting is automatic,

26
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:07,090
and then crank the resolution value up

27
00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:09,030
to whatever it is you want,

28
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:13,000
in my case, I'm going to go up to 600 pixels per inch,

29
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,090
which is going to double the number of pixels horizontally,

30
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:18,070
as well as double the number of pixels vertically,

31
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:23,060
so that we have four times as many pixels as we had before.

32
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:26,020
At which point, I'll go ahead and click the okay button

33
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:28,090
in order to upsample that image.

34
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:31,060
Now, it may take a moment in order to apply the change,

35
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:34,020
after which point, I'll go up to the File menu

36
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:36,020
and choose the Save As command,

37
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:41,040
and I ended up saving this file as Upsampled to 600 ppi.jpg

38
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,040
because I'm working with the JPEG format,

39
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,060
and I'll even just go ahead and save over my original image

40
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:49,040
by clicking on the Save button, followed by Yes.

41
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,060
You always want to make sure your JPEG options

42
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:55,010
are cranked up to the highest quality, which is 12,

43
00:01:55,010 --> 00:01:58,010
and if you set your format options to Baseline Optimized

44
00:01:58,010 --> 00:02:01,030
you'll generally get a slightly smaller file,

45
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:03,010
at which point, go ahead and click okay

46
00:02:03,010 --> 00:02:05,060
in order to save that image.

47
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:07,030
Now I'll return to Illustrator.

48
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:10,070
To be safe, make sure that nothing is selected on screen,

49
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:13,000
and then once again go to the File menu

50
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,080
and choose the Place command,

51
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,050
or you've got that keyboard shortcut of control shift P,

52
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:19,080
or command shift P on the Mac.

53
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:22,050
Then, I'll go ahead and locate that file I just created

54
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:25,000
and I'll click on the Place button in order to

55
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,050
load my cursor with the image,

56
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:28,030
and I'll just go ahead and click,

57
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:31,060
not drag, with the cursor in order to place the image

58
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:33,010
at its full size.

59
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:35,060
And now, I'll just go ahead and drag it into place,

60
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:37,080
and assuming that your smart guides are turned on,

61
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:40,020
it should snap into perfect alignment.

62
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:42,070
Alright now, go ahead and zoom in just a little bit

63
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:45,010
and I'll return to the Image Trace button

64
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:47,000
and just go ahead and click on it.

65
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,010
At which point, of course, Illustrator will warn me

66
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:51,080
that this is gonna take a while to trace,

67
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:54,060
because after all, I'm working in a higher resolution.

68
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:56,000
But that's what we want.

69
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,010
You may at this point want to turn on the Don't show again

70
00:02:58,010 --> 00:03:00,060
checkbox so you're not reminded of this bad advice

71
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:04,010
in the future, after which point, go ahead and click okay

72
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:06,040
in order to begin the trace.

73
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:08,050
And it is gonna take a few moments here,

74
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:11,030
you are gonna see one or two progress bars go by,

75
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:14,020
after which point, I'll just go ahead and zoom in,

76
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:16,060
and I'll click off the image to deselect it,

77
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:18,060
and now let's take a look at the difference

78
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:20,060
between the higher resolution scan

79
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:22,060
and the lower res scan.

80
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:24,030
And it's probably gonna make a little more sense

81
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:25,080
if I zoom in a little farther.

82
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:28,060
This is the tracing of the 300 pixel per inch image,

83
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:32,060
and this is the tracing of the 600 pixel per inch image.

84
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:36,010
And as you can see, we get more fidelity in this tracing,

85
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:38,060
we have a lot more lines to work with.

86
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:41,000
And it's especially noticeable down here

87
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,080
where we've got some words.

88
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:45,000
This is the 300 pixel per inch version,

89
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,040
versus the 600 pixel per inch version.

90
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:50,060
And so you can make that kind of difference

91
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:54,020
just by upsampling the image inside Photoshop

92
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:57,060
before you trace it in Illustrator, after which point,

93
00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:00,010
I'll go ahead and rename this newest tracing

94
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:02,050
600 ppi and press the enter key,

95
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:05,090
or the return key on the Mac, to accept that change.

96
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:08,020
Alright, and just to be safe, I'll go ahead and turn off

97
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:11,000
the 300 ppi version of the image.

98
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Alright so we are making some very positive modifications

99
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,070
to this tracing, but we can do better still

100
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:19,010
with the fragile details by adjusting

101
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:23,020
the threshold setting, as I'll show you in the next movie.
