1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,080
- [Voiceover] In this movie, I'll show you how to trace

2
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:04,060
a piece of artwork using nothing but uniform strokes.

3
00:00:04,060 --> 00:00:07,060
And you can see here that the effect are pretty great.

4
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:10,020
The thing is, it's a more intensive process

5
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:12,040
for Illustrator so it takes more time.

6
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:15,040
So this piece of artwork happen to start as a pencil sketch

7
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:18,000
that I did with my youngest son, Sam.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,010
And then I took it into Photoshop and firmed up the lines.

9
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:22,060
Alright, so here's how it works:

10
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:24,060
Step one is to go to the file menu

11
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:26,040
and choose the new command, or of course,

12
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:29,030
you can press Ctrl+N, or command+N on the Mac.

13
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:32,060
And I once again started with a basic RGB document

14
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:35,000
and I went in, switched the orientation to portrait,

15
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,060
and clicked OK.

16
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:38,070
Alright, next step is to go to the file menu,

17
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:39,090
and choose the place command

18
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:42,060
or press Crt+Shift+P or Command+Shift+P on a Mac.

19
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:44,050
And then, if you're working along with me,

20
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:46,080
go ahead and locate that scanned pencil sketch,

21
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:48,080
and click the Place button.

22
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:50,090
And then, click inside the document window,

23
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:52,020
don't drag, just click,

24
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:54,090
in order to place that image on the art board.

25
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:56,000
Alright, next I'm going to go ahead

26
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,020
and switch to the art board tool,

27
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:58,050
and as you can see here,

28
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:00,090
I've switched back to the single column tool box

29
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:03,000
just to take up less room on screen.

30
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,060
And now, assuming that your smart guides are turned on,

31
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:09,000
go ahead and drag the corners until they snap into alignment

32
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,060
with the corner of the artwork

33
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:14,010
and then press the Escape key to exit the art work mode.

34
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:16,010
Alright, now I'm going to go ahead and zoom in

35
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:18,080
on my artwork quite a bit so I can keep track

36
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:21,040
of the top portion of this document.

37
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,050
And I'll go up to the image trace button,

38
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:26,060
and simply click on it to start things off.

39
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:28,010
And if you get that warning saying

40
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:30,090
there's too much resolution, just go ahead and click, OK

41
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:34,000
in order to ignore that dreadful advice.

42
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,010
In a few moments later,

43
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:38,050
Illustrator will work its default magic on the image.

44
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:40,000
Alright, now what we want to do is

45
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,080
bring up the Image Trace panel,

46
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:43,000
which you can do by clicking on this

47
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,070
Image Trace icon up here in the Control panel.

48
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:48,090
If necessary, go ahead and twirl open the Advance Settings,

49
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:52,050
like so, and for now, turn off the preview check box.

50
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:53,040
And the reason is,

51
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,070
I've already explained how these options work

52
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:57,050
and I just want to dial in a bunch of them

53
00:01:57,050 --> 00:02:00,010
that happen to work well for this particular image.

54
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:02,000
So, I'll start by taking the threshold value

55
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,060
all the way up to 230 and that way,

56
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:07,070
we're tracing more of the artwork instead of less.

57
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:10,000
And I'll Tab my way down to the Noise value,

58
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,050
and take it down to just five pixels.

59
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:15,070
Next, you want to turn off Snap Curves to Lines,

60
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:18,040
and turn on Ignore White so that we're going to end up

61
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:20,060
tracing just black and not white.

62
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:24,000
And then finally, turn off the Fills check box,

63
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,090
and what that's going to do is force Strokes to turn on.

64
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:29,070
You can trace both filled and stroked paths if you like,

65
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:32,040
but that's not really the effect we're looking for.

66
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,090
So just go ahead and turn off the Fills check box.

67
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:37,030
And then, click on the Trace button.

68
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:39,090
That's an alternative to the Preview check box by the way.

69
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:42,070
An alternative way to at least invoke a trace.

70
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:45,040
And a few moments later, you should see

71
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,050
a bunch of trace strokes on screen.

72
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:49,090
If Illustrator freaks out a little bit in the mean time,

73
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:51,000
don't worry about it.

74
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,030
It shouldn't crash, it should hang in there,

75
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:54,030
but you never know.

76
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:57,010
Again, this is a complex process for the program.

77
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:59,010
Alight, now given the default settings,

78
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:02,000
we have a ton of gaps in the illustration

79
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,080
and that's because of this Stroke option right here.

80
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,070
And notice it's telling us the maximum width and pixels

81
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:10,020
that will be recognized and converted to strokes paths.

82
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:12,050
So in other words, the bigger the value,

83
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:14,050
the fewer gaps you'll get.

84
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:16,040
But you don't want to take the value too high,

85
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:19,020
because that will result in longer delays.

86
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:21,070
So what I recommend is you move in kinda baby steps

87
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:23,020
and so what I'm going to do is

88
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:25,030
take the Stroke Value up to 20 pixels

89
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:28,040
and then press the Enter key or the Return key on the Mac

90
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,090
to invoke that change.

91
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:32,010
And notice the Preview check box is back on

92
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:35,070
so in a few moments, we should see a progress bar or two.

93
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:38,060
If it just seems like Illustrator's ignoring you,

94
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:40,080
just hang in there and wait a moment

95
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,020
and notice I never did see a progress bar

96
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:46,050
but Illustrator did go ahead and complete the trace.

97
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:49,010
Now what we want to do is check things

98
00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:51,050
to make sure everything looks the way it should

99
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:56,030
and you should see very few, if any gaps inside the artwork.

100
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:58,020
In particular, this little pocket pen

101
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:00,060
should be traced in its entirety.

102
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:03,040
And in my case everything looks pretty darn good.

103
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:06,080
Now one of the things about auto-tracing stroked artwork

104
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,040
is you cannot control the line weight

105
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,000
until you expand the path outlines.

106
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,040
So I'm going to go ahead and close the image Trace panel

107
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:16,090
and I'm going to make some modifications here

108
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:19,040
inside the Layers panel by clicking on a fly-out menu icon,

109
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,050
choosing Panel Options, then selecting Other,

110
00:04:22,050 --> 00:04:25,020
and changing that value to 70 pixels.

111
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:28,040
And then I'll just go ahead and rename the layer Tracing

112
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:30,090
and twirl it open as well.

113
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:33,020
Now, we want to keep the original traced artwork

114
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:34,030
we don't want to lose it.

115
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:37,090
So what you can do is copy and paste in front, if you like.

116
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:39,090
But my experience is that Illustrator,

117
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:43,010
as often as not when you copy this piece of artwork

118
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:45,040
will crash, at least on this machine.

119
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:48,020
So, an alternate to using the Clipboard at all

120
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:51,010
is to press the Alt key or the Option key on the Mac

121
00:04:51,010 --> 00:04:54,020
and drag this item, like so, just drag it up a little bit.

122
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:57,010
And so that's an Alt+drag or an Option+drag

123
00:04:57,010 --> 00:04:58,070
and that'll create a copy of it

124
00:04:58,070 --> 00:05:00,050
without going to the Clipboard,

125
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:02,050
which is a lot easier on Illustrator,

126
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:05,030
and possibly easier on your nerves as well.

127
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:07,060
Alright, now I'm going to turn off the original.

128
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:09,030
And then I'll go up the the Control Panel

129
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:11,000
and click on the Expand button

130
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,050
in order to scan this special object to Static Path Outlines

131
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:17,080
and then I'll change the line wight to 1.2 points

132
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:20,020
in order to produce this effect here.

133
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:22,030
And if you get a little warning saying that

134
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:23,070
Illustrator can't do it,

135
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:27,000
just click OK and it should do it anyway.

136
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,060
Alright, now we want to simplify the art.

137
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:31,030
So go ahead and press Ctrl+H or Command+H on the Mac

138
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:32,090
to hide the anchor points.

139
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:34,060
And then go the the Object menu,

140
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:37,000
choose Path, and choose Simplify.

141
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,090
And this one really responds poorly to the default settings

142
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:45,030
This sun is a complete mess and this moon is a disaster.

143
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:46,090
So what I suggest you do

144
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:50,010
is once again take this Curve Position value up to 100%,

145
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:52,030
then press the Tab key and notice,

146
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:54,010
assuming the preview check box is turned on,

147
00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:57,010
that the number of anchor points goes up,

148
00:05:57,010 --> 00:05:58,000
which is not what we want,

149
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,080
so go ahead and click in that Curved Position value

150
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:03,060
and press the Down arrow key in order to reduce the value

151
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:06,010
until the artwork starts to change

152
00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:07,050
more than you're comfortable with,

153
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:09,090
which once again happens for me at 97%

154
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:13,020
so I'll press the Up arrow key to take that value up to 98%

155
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:15,080
but we're still losing more than 1000 anchor points

156
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,080
which is great.

157
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:19,090
And then I just experimented with this Angle Threshold value

158
00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:23,010
but notice how the moon's hand changes; his elbow as well.

159
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:25,070
When I take that value up to 100 degrees,

160
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:28,000
we get a little more bending action.

161
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,050
And incidental, you can take this value all the way up

162
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:33,040
to 180 degrees if you like, but to my mind,

163
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:35,060
that doesn't create exactly the right effect.

164
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:37,070
So, once again, I'll take it to 100 degrees

165
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:39,000
You can see we're still dropping

166
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,050
more than 1000 anchor points,

167
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:42,070
at which point I'll go ahead and click OK

168
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:44,090
to apply that change.

169
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:47,020
And that's how you trace a piece of scanned artwork

170
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:51,040
using nothing but Uniform Strokes, here inside Illustrator.

171
01:59:58,000 --> 01:59:59:000
