00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,090
- [Voiceover] We've spent so much trying

2
00:00:01,090 --> 00:00:04,000
to basically make sure we have an exact

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,080
vector replica of the original drawing.

4
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:08,050
Why even bother?

5
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:10,040
If we already have the original drawing,

6
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:13,010
why are we working so hard to turn it into vectors?

7
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:15,000
And the most straightforward answer is,

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
not only have we managed to correct the art,

9
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,010
because recall that it used to be a pretty dismal scan

10
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:22,030
in the first place, but the ultimate reason

11
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:25,000
for converting it to vectors is so we can

12
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
scale the artwork to any size we like.

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,080
And so let me show you how that works.

14
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:31,050
I'll go ahead and press Control + 0

15
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:33,070
or Command + 0 on a Mac to zoom out,

16
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:35,090
and I'm gonna switch to the Artwork tool.

17
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:38,050
Once again, you can get that by pressing Shift + O,

18
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:41,050
and up here in the control panel I'm gonna click

19
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:44,070
inside the W value there and I'm just gonna enter

20
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:48,010
*10 in order to multiply it times 10,

21
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:51,060
so we go up to 4320 points, and then

22
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:53,090
I'm gonna do the same with the height value,

23
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:57,030
I'll multiply it times 10 by entering *10 there,

24
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:00,050
and then pressing the Tab key, and we get 5400 points.

25
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:02,060
And that is, by the way, if you do the math,

26
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:05,080
five feet wide by six and a quarter feet tall.

27
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:07,090
All right, now I'm gonna press Control + 0

28
00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:09,090
or Command + 0 on a Mac to zoom out

29
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:13,030
so you can get a sense of how much bigger this artwork is,

30
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:15,050
and then I'll press the Escape key in order

31
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:17,080
to return control to the black arrow tool.

32
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:20,020
Now press Control + A or Command + A on a Mac

33
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:22,090
to select all of the artwork, and I'll click

34
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:25,050
on the word Transform up here in the control panel,

35
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:28,010
or you may see a W and H value instead,

36
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:30,000
depending on the width of your screen.

37
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,090
And I'm gonna make sure both the width

38
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:34,040
and height values are locked into alignment with each other,

39
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:36,080
and I'll click on the W to select that value

40
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:39,030
and I'll change it to 3800 points,

41
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:41,050
and then I'll press the Enter key

42
00:01:41,050 --> 00:01:44,020
or the Return key on the Mac to apply that change.

43
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:47,000
And we now have what is by any standard

44
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,030
this massive piece of artwork that would have been

45
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:52,090
very difficult to draw in the first place.

46
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:55,000
I don't see how it would have come up with

47
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,060
these gestures at all if I were trying to draw

48
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:00,030
something that's actually taller than I am.

49
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:03,080
And yet, if I press Control + 1 or Command + 1 on a Mac,

50
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:07,000
in order to zoom in to 100%, you can see

51
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,080
that we have this wonderful detail

52
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:13,000
that we could not achieve in any other way.

53
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,070
All right, and just as a finishing touch here,

54
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:18,060
I decided I wanted to thicken up the lines a little bit

55
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:21,040
for the sake of, let's just say my signature,

56
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,060
and so I press Control + A once again,

57
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:25,080
Command + A on the Mac to select all the artwork,

58
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:28,020
I press Control + H or Command + H on a Mac

59
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:30,020
just to hide those anchor points,

60
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:32,060
and then I went ahead and changed the line weight

61
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:34,090
up here in the control panel to two points

62
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:38,050
in order to thicken things ever so slightly.

63
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:41,000
And because by default the stroke is centered,

64
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
we're actually only adding one point of weight

65
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,090
to either side of any given line.

66
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:49,080
And that's how you turn a simple piece of line art

67
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:53,000
from the year 1986, a year before Illustrator

68
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,090
had even hit the market, into a massive piece

69
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:59,090
of vector-based artwork here inside Illustrator.

70
01:59:58,000 --> 01:59:59:000
