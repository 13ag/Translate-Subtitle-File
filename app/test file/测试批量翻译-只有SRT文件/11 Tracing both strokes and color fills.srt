1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:01,060
- [Voiceover] In this movie we'll take a look

2
00:00:01,060 --> 00:00:05,010
at how you can combine strokes along with colored fills

3
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:07,060
when tracing our work inside Illustrator.

4
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:10,020
So here we are looking at a Vector take

5
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:14,050
on Albrecht Durer's classic 16th century rhinoceros,

6
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:15,070
which might be better than

7
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:17,090
the last illustration we looked at.

8
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:18,080
And so let's see how we can

9
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:20,090
put something like this together.

10
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:22,010
I'm gonna create a new document

11
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:25,020
just by pressing "control n" or "command n" on the Mac.

12
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:27,080
And I'll once again set the profile to basic RGB,

13
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:30,050
this time our horizontal orientation is gonna work great.

14
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:32,010
At which point I'll click okay

15
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:33,090
in order to create that document.

16
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:35,070
Then, I'll go on up to the file menu

17
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:37,040
and choose the place command,

18
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,070
again we have a keyboard shortcut

19
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:41,080
of "control shift p" or "command shift p" on the Mac.

20
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:44,050
And I've got this image here called "Grayscale rhino tif"

21
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:46,000
that I'll just go ahead and double-click

22
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,060
in order to load my cursor and then I'll click

23
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:51,090
being careful not to drag inside the document window.

24
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:54,020
Alright, now I want to scale the art board to fit the image.

25
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:56,020
So I'll select the art board tool,

26
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:57,070
which I can get by pressing "shift o,"

27
00:00:57,070 --> 00:01:00,000
and I'll go ahead and drag the corners

28
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,080
until they snap into position

29
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:03,050
with the help of smart guides.

30
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:05,080
After which point I'll press the escape key

31
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:08,000
in order to exit the art board mode.

32
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,050
And I'll go to the layers panel,

33
00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:11,000
look in the fly-out menu icon,

34
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,040
choose panel options.

35
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:14,030
I just can't stand small thumbnails

36
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:17,040
so I'll select other and change the size to 70 pixels.

37
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,080
And then I'll just go ahead and rename this layer "tracings"

38
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,030
and press the enter key or the return key on the Mac.

39
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:25,060
Now at this point the image is looking pretty terrible

40
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:28,010
and that's because we're so far zoomed out from it,

41
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:30,010
but if you zoom in to 300% or more

42
00:01:30,010 --> 00:01:32,000
it'll start looking a lot better.

43
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,090
Alright, now I'll click the image trace button

44
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:36,010
and ignore the warning by clicking okay.

45
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:37,050
In order to give Illustrator a chance

46
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:39,040
to take a first swing at things.

47
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:42,000
And then I'll click on the image trace panel icon

48
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
to bring up said panel.

49
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,030
Alright, now I happen to know

50
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:46,050
some settings I want to apply here.

51
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:49,020
So I'm gonna twirl open the advanced area

52
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:51,060
and I'm going to turn off the preview for a moment

53
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:53,020
while I adjust some settings.

54
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:54,060
I know I want to switch the mode

55
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:56,060
from black and white to grayscale,

56
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:59,010
so that we can trace various shades of gray.

57
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:00,050
At which point Illustrator asks you

58
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:02,010
how many grays you'd like,

59
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:03,080
I'm just gonna leave it set to 50,

60
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:05,090
but you can adjust that value to taste.

61
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:09,030
I'm gonna take the number of paths up to 100%,

62
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:12,010
I'm gonna take the corners' value down to 50%,

63
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:15,060
and I'll take the noise value down to just one.

64
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:17,040
Then I'll turn on the "ignore white" checkbox

65
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:20,080
and I'll turn off "snap curves to lines,"

66
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,070
and finally I'll click on the trace button

67
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:24,070
to see what Illustrator comes up with.

68
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:25,050
And bear in mind,

69
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:28,010
this time it's gonna create more path outlines,

70
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:30,040
but they're gonna be various shades of gray

71
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,070
this time around.

72
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:35,020
So obviously we have a more complex tracing

73
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:36,090
then we've seen in the past.

74
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:39,040
And in my case my screen is turning black,

75
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,020
but once it finishes we can see

76
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:43,020
these wonderful shades of gray

77
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:45,000
that Illustrator's come up with.

78
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,070
Alright, now let's add some strokes on top of them.

79
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:49,040
By first getting the image trace panel

80
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,000
out of the way of the layers panel.

81
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,090
And then I'll twirl open that panel

82
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:54,050
and grab this guy right there

83
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:57,050
and alt or option drag him up ever so slightly

84
00:02:57,050 --> 00:02:59,040
to create a duplicate.

85
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,070
Then you wanna make sure that

86
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:03,000
that top tracing is selected.

87
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,060
Turn off the preview checkbox once again,

88
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:08,010
switch the mode back to black and white,

89
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:09,040
because notice that the fills

90
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,070
and strokes check boxes are dimmed

91
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:14,060
when we're working in either color or grayscale.

92
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:16,070
So go ahead and switch back to black and white.

93
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:19,070
I'm gonna set the threshold this time to 150,

94
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:22,020
the other values are fine as is

95
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:24,040
except for the fact that I'm gonna turn off fills,

96
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:26,040
which automatically turns on strokes,

97
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,040
and I'm gonna change the stroke value

98
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:30,040
right there to 20 pixels.

99
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,070
After which point I'll go ahead

100
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:33,030
and click the trace button once again

101
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:36,030
in order to apply my settings.

102
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:38,050
Now, it's gonna look terrible at first

103
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:40,060
and that's because you can't adjust the line weight

104
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:42,050
until you expand the strokes.

105
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:45,060
So what we're gonna do is select this entire layer

106
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:48,030
and then bring up the layer's panel's fly-out menu

107
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:50,010
and choose duplicate tracings

108
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:52,020
in order to duplicate that layer.

109
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:54,010
Now what you wanna do is scroll down here

110
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:58,030
and turn off the top tracing in this blue tracing layer.

111
00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:00,080
And then just go ahead and twirl this layer closed.

112
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:04,030
And double-click on an empty portion of the top layer,

113
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:06,000
the one we just duplicated,

114
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,030
and let's change it to "expanded"

115
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:10,080
and change the color to light red

116
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,020
just so we can tell it apart.

117
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:15,070
Alright, now with this big stroked object selected,

118
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:18,040
click on the expand button up here in the control panel.

119
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:20,060
And then let's take the line weight value

120
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:23,030
down to just 0.3 points

121
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:26,030
in order to produce these much more delicate lines here.

122
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:29,020
Alright, now I wanna colorize the grays a little bit

123
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:31,010
so I'm gonna hide the image trace panel

124
00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:34,070
and I'm gonna select this lower object right here.

125
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:36,040
And notice it's appearing blue,

126
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,060
that's just because you have to collapse

127
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:41,020
and expand this layer once again for it to turn red.

128
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:42,090
And so with it selected,

129
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:45,050
go ahead and click on the expand button once again,

130
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:49,060
in order to expand the trace object to static path outlines.

131
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:50,090
Alright, now I wanna go ahead

132
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:53,080
and fuse all these objects together.

133
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:56,000
And this is a kind of preview of coming attractions

134
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,040
in the very next chapter.

135
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,000
What I want you to do is go up to the window menu

136
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,030
and choose pathfinder to bring up the pathfinder panel.

137
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:04,050
And then just go ahead and click

138
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:07,060
on this very first icon in the first row.

139
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:09,090
What it does is it goes ahead and unites

140
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:11,080
all of these various path outlines

141
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:14,040
into one overarching outline,

142
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,060
which is just gonna make things

143
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:17,060
a little simpler in the long run.

144
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:19,010
And as you can see,

145
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:20,030
you're gonna get a progress bar

146
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:21,040
because we are creating

147
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:24,040
a fairly extraordinarily complicated document here.

148
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:26,000
So try to be patient with Illustrator

149
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,060
as it does its best.

150
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:30,030
Then I'll go ahead and hide the pathfinder panel,

151
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:33,080
and I'll click on the fill icon up here in the control panel

152
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:36,040
and I'll change it to this medium shade of blue,

153
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:40,030
which is "R0G113B188."

154
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:43,020
And then finally I'll click on the word "Opacity,"

155
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:45,010
once again up here in the control panel.

156
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:46,090
And I'm gonna change the blend mode,

157
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:48,030
which is a topic that we'll be looking at

158
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:50,090
in a future chapter of this very course,

159
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:53,030
and I'm gonna change the mode to color

160
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:56,070
so that we're colorizing the rhinoceros in the background.

161
00:05:56,070 --> 00:06:00,000
And then I'm gonna take the opacity value down to 50%

162
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,030
and press the enter key or the return key on the Mac

163
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:03,080
to hide that panel.

164
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:05,030
And finally, I'll go ahead and press

165
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:08,020
"control shift a" or "command shift a" on the Mac

166
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:10,050
in order to deselect that artwork.

167
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:12,050
And I will press the "f" key

168
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:15,020
a couple of times to switch to the fullscreen mode.

169
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:16,020
And I'll go ahead and press

170
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:18,080
"control 0" or "command 0" on the Mac

171
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:21,050
in order to fit the artwork on screen.

172
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:23,050
And that folks is at least one way

173
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:26,010
to combine strokes along with colored fills

174
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:28,060
when auto-tracing a piece of classic artwork

175
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:30,060
here inside Illustrator.
