1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,010
- [Voiceover] In this movie, I'll show you the other way

2
00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:04,030
to get a pixel-based image into Illustrator.

3
00:00:04,030 --> 00:00:06,090
And that's to use the 'place' command to create

4
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:10,000
a dynamic link to the image file on disk.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,080
So, the first step is to go up to the 'File' menu

6
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:14,000
and choose the 'New' command, or you can press

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
control N here on the PC, or command N on the Mac.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,030
And I'm going to go ahead and change the profile

9
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:23,040
to basic RGB, which these days appears to set

10
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:25,030
the orientation to landscape.

11
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:27,070
I'm going to go ahead and switch it to portrait

12
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:29,090
by clicking on this little icon here.

13
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:32,020
And then I'll click OK.

14
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:34,070
Next, what you want to do is go up to the 'File' menu

15
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:36,050
and choose the 'Place' command,

16
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:39,020
which has a keyboard shortcut of control shift P here on

17
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:42,040
the PC, or command shift P on the Mac.

18
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:44,080
Then, locate the image file that you want to import,

19
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:46,050
and click on the 'place' button.

20
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:49,030
Now, that goes ahead and loads your cursor with the image.

21
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:51,020
At this point, you want to be very careful that

22
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:53,050
you click instead of drag.

23
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:55,050
If you drag with the cursor, you will scale

24
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:57,030
the image as you import it.

25
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:59,080
And that is generally not something you want to do,

26
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:03,030
especially when tracing images inside Illustrator.

27
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:05,090
So just go ahead and click, and you'll import the

28
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:07,070
full-sized image.

29
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:09,070
All right, now assuming that you want to scale the

30
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:12,020
artboard to match the image, go ahead and switch

31
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:14,020
to the artboard tool, which once again you can get

32
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:16,020
by pressing shift O.

33
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:18,060
And then, assuming that you have your smart guides

34
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:21,030
turned on, just go ahead and drag the top left

35
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:24,030
and bottom right corners so they snap into alignment

36
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:26,090
with the image and then you can press the escape key

37
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:28,090
to exit the artboard mode.

38
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:30,090
All right, now go ahead and press control zero or

39
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:33,000
command zero on a Mac to zoom in.

40
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Now, let's take a look at a few key differences when

41
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,060
working with linked images as opposed to embedded ones.

42
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:41,010
Notice I once again have this link up here that

43
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:43,050
tells me the name of the original file on disk,

44
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:46,040
but if I click on it, I bring up a whole slew of

45
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:49,010
options including edit original.

46
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:50,080
And this one is very important.

47
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:53,020
If I choose this command, then Illustrator will

48
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:55,050
go ahead and switch me back to Photoshop,

49
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:58,010
at which point if I make a modification as I did

50
00:01:58,010 --> 00:02:00,090
in the previous movie, or I go to the 'Image' menu

51
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:03,010
choose 'Image Rotation' and choose 'Flip Canvas

52
00:02:03,010 --> 00:02:06,020
Horizontal,' and then go to the 'File' menu and

53
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:09,020
choose the 'Save' command to update the file on disk.

54
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:11,090
Now if I go ahead and switch back to Illustrator,

55
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:15,000
notice that Illustrator is aware of the modifications,

56
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,020
and asks me if I would like to update the image.

57
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:20,070
At which point if I click yes, then I'm going to see

58
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:24,050
that update occur inside Illustrator.

59
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:26,060
This isn't really what I want, however, so I'll

60
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:29,030
go ahead and choose that command again, or I could

61
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:31,080
just click on the 'Edit Original' button up here

62
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:33,020
in the control panel.

63
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:35,010
And I'll go up to the 'Edit' menu and choose

64
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:37,060
'Step Backward' in order to turn the image to its

65
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:40,050
original appearance and then I will once again choose

66
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:42,080
the 'Save' command from the 'File' menu, after which

67
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:46,000
point I'll go ahead and switch to Illustrator.

68
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,030
Now, let's say I say no, that I don't want

69
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:50,020
to update my changes.

70
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:53,050
I can always update the changes later on by clicking

71
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:56,000
on this link up here in the control panel once again

72
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,040
and choosing 'Update Link' in order to reflect the

73
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,070
modifications that I made in Photoshop.

74
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:05,060
Another subtle advantage to working this way is that

75
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:08,080
Illustrator has gone ahead and populated my swatches

76
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,040
panel, as we are seeing up here in the upper right

77
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,050
corner of the screen.

78
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:14,020
And of course if you're not seeing your swatches

79
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:16,040
panel, you can just go to the 'Window' menu,

80
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:20,030
choose the 'Swatches' command, which for me is located

81
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:21,090
way down here.

82
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:24,060
And of course if you can't see your swatches panel,

83
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:26,050
you can go up to the 'Window' menu and choose the

84
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:28,020
'Swatches' command.

85
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:30,010
Compare that to what happens when you open

86
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:31,040
an image directly.

87
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,060
Notice over here in the swatches panel,

88
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:37,000
we have just none and the registration swatch.

89
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,090
If you want more, you'd have to click on the

90
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:41,000
little library icon in the bottom left corner

91
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,080
of the swatches panel, choose 'Default Swatches,'

92
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:46,090
and then choose 'Basic RGB,' and then you'd have

93
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:49,070
to go ahead and select all these guys by clicking

94
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:51,090
on the last swatch, shift clicking on the first one

95
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:55,000
and then dragging them and dropping them

96
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,090
into the swatches panel.

97
00:03:56,090 --> 00:03:58,070
So, you can still get to those swatches,

98
00:03:58,070 --> 00:04:00,030
but it takes an extra step.

99
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:02,070
And then finally I want you to see when you select

100
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:05,000
an embedded image by clicking on it, you see a

101
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,050
selection outline around the outer edge.

102
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:09,090
Whereas, when you click on a linked image,

103
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:12,070
it's an X through the center of it as well.

104
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:14,070
Now, if you ever change your mind, you do have

105
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:15,080
an embed button.

106
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:17,070
So you can just go ahead and click on it to

107
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:20,050
embed that image, and you will lose the X.

108
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:22,030
That's not what I want, however, because that would

109
00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:25,020
break the dynamic link to the image file on disk.

110
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:27,010
So I'll just go ahead and press control Z,

111
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:30,010
or command Z on the Mac to undo that change.

112
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:31,090
And then, finally, a little bit of housekeeping here

113
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:33,060
inside the layers panel.

114
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:35,040
I'm going to click on the flyout menu icon in the

115
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,090
upper left corner, and choose 'Panel Options'.

116
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:41,040
And then I'll go ahead and increase this row size

117
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,040
value to other and I want it to be 70 pixels

118
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:47,010
so I can actually see what's going on inside

119
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:50,010
the panel there so that I have larger previews.

120
00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:52,070
And then, I'll just go ahead and rename this layer

121
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:55,020
tracing, let's say, and press the enter key,

122
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:58,060
or the return key on the Mac, to apply that change.

123
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:01,050
Finally, I'm going to twirl this guy open,

124
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:04,040
and I'm going to rename this image 300 ppi.

125
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:06,080
And by the way, ppi stands for the resolution of

126
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:10,050
this image, which is 300 pixels per inch.

127
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:12,070
And you can see that reflected up here in the

128
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:14,040
control panel as well.

129
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:17,000
And that will become very important in the next movie

130
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,050
when we discuss how to autotrace the image.

131
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:23,010
And that is the difference between linking to an

132
00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:25,050
image file on disk using the place command

133
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:28,080
versus embedding the image using the open command.

134
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:31,050
And the last piece of good news is that this file

135
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:34,030
with the linked image is about half as big

136
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:36,080
as the one with the embedded image.

137
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:40,040
And so you have a more efficient workflow as well.

138
01:59:58,000 --> 01:59:59:000
