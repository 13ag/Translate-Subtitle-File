1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:02,020
- [Voiceover] In this movie, I'll show you how to auto-trace

2
00:00:02,020 --> 00:00:04,000
an image inside Illustrator.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,070
And I'll also show you the effects of resolution

4
00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:08,060
on the quality of the results.

5
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:12,060
And the very short story there is more resolution is better.

6
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:15,010
So the first thing I'm gonna do is click on my image

7
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:17,060
with the black arrow tool in order to select it.

8
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:19,050
Notice we can see the resolution up here

9
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:20,090
in the control panel.

10
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:23,030
Ppi stands for pixels per inch.

11
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:27,000
300 tells us that we have 300 pixels per inch,

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,020
both horizontally, as well as vertically.

13
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:33,080
Which means 90,000 pixels per square inch.

14
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:37,040
Which is your typical professional quality print resolution.

15
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:39,020
Alright, I'm gonna need a copy of this guy

16
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:40,080
for demonstration purposes,

17
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:43,060
so I'll go up to the edit menu and choose the copy command,

18
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:45,020
or of course, you can press control + c

19
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:47,020
or command + c on a Mac.

20
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:50,000
Next, notice this image trace button right there.

21
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,070
If you click on the down-pointing arrow head next to it,

22
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:54,070
you'll see a menu of presets.

23
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:56,090
If you're tracing a photograph and you want color,

24
00:00:56,090 --> 00:00:59,050
then you can try out one of these first two guys.

25
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:02,050
The next ones trace low-color images including

26
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:04,020
just shades of gray.

27
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:06,090
If you drop down to line art and technical drawing,

28
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:09,040
which would seem like the best settings, just know that

29
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,040
they trace stroked outlines.

30
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,090
Which may turn out to be what you want, and I am going to

31
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:16,040
include a movie about that inside this chapter,

32
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:18,070
but they're very slow.

33
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:21,000
For this kind of artwork, you want one of the

34
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,010
black and white options, which will trace

35
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:25,050
filled path outlines, and so you could try

36
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:28,050
black and white logo, sketched art, or silhouettes.

37
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:31,040
Or better still, just go ahead and click on the

38
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:35,010
image trace button and let Illustrator do it's thing.

39
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:36,080
Now, at this point it's going to warn you that

40
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:40,010
it's going to take a moment or two to trace the artwork.

41
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:42,090
And that's because we have a large image, meaning that

42
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:44,060
it contains a lot of pixels.

43
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:47,020
If you want to reduce the image size, you can rasterize it

44
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:50,080
to a lower resolution using the rasterize command

45
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,030
under the object menu.

46
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:54,060
I'll show you what that looks like in just a moment,

47
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:58,000
but this is terrible advice as you're about to see.

48
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,080
So I'm just going to go ahead and click okay in order

49
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:02,000
to trace the artwork.

50
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,030
It is going to take a moment, and you may see

51
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:07,000
a few progress bars, after which point you'll see

52
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,010
the traced version of the artwork.

53
00:02:09,010 --> 00:02:12,020
Which isn't gonna look nun too good at this point.

54
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:14,090
We're gonna make it look much better in future movies.

55
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:17,090
But let's see how that compares to tracing a low resolution

56
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:21,040
version of the image as Illustrator just recommended.

57
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:24,060
I'll go ahead and press control + f, or command + f on a Mac

58
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:27,090
in order to paste a copy of the original pixel-based image.

59
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:30,070
And then I'm gonna twirl open this tracing layer here

60
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:34,010
inside the layers panel, and I'm gonna rename this guy,

61
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:36,080
the new one, 72 ppi.

62
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,080
And then, to lower the resolution of the artwork,

63
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:41,070
I'll go up to the object menu

64
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:43,080
and choose the rasterize command.

65
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:46,030
And I'll leave the color model set to RGB.

66
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:50,080
And I'll set the resolution to screen, 72 ppi.

67
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,050
The other settings really don't matter for our purpose.

68
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:56,050
So I'll go ahead and click okay in order to reduce

69
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:58,070
the resolution of that image.

70
00:02:58,070 --> 00:03:00,030
And you can see the difference.

71
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:02,070
This is the before version, which is pretty sharp,

72
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:07,030
and this is the after version, which is pretty darn choppy.

73
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:09,000
Alright, let's see what kind of difference that

74
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,060
makes for image tracing.

75
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:13,000
I'll once again go up to the image trace button

76
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,040
and just click on it.

77
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:16,060
Notice this time Illustrator doesn't complain

78
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:18,080
and it's lickety-split fast,

79
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:21,040
but it looks absolutely terrible.

80
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,030
So this is the 300 ppi resolution version of the image.

81
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:27,080
And this is the 72 ppi.

82
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:29,030
And so the moral of the story is

83
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:32,010
you always want more pixels, not fewer.

84
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:34,060
It is going to take Illustrator a little additional time

85
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:37,070
in order to perform the trace, but it's gonna give you

86
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:39,040
better results as well.

87
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:42,070
And notice now by the way, that Illustrator has gone ahead

88
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:45,020
and renamed these objects image tracing.

89
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:47,030
I want to remember their original resolution,

90
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:50,080
so I'm gonna change the bottom one to 300 ppi,

91
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:55,000
and I'm gonna rename the top guy 72 ppi.

92
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,030
And then I'm gonna change their order as well

93
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:59,070
so the better tracing is on top.

94
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:02,080
And that's how you perform a first-pass auto tracing,

95
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:05,060
preferably on a high resolution image

96
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:07,060
here inside Illustrator.
