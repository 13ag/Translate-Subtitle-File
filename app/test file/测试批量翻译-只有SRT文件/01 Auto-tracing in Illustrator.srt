1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,040
- We're going to start things off with one of my

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:04,070
favorite features in Illustrator which goes

3
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:07,040
by the unassuming name Image Trace.

4
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:10,010
Among other things, it can trace scanned line art.

5
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:11,060
Meaning that you can take something

6
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:13,040
made with traditional tools,

7
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:15,050
things like pens and pieces of paper,

8
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:17,050
and then scan or photograph it,

9
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:20,080
and convert it to vectors inside illustrator.

10
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:23,060
In this chapter, I'll walk you through three scenarios.

11
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:25,050
We'll start with this pen and ink portrait

12
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:29,030
that I drew for a local newspaper article back in 1986,

13
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:32,000
a year before Illustrator started shipping.

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Not only does this prove that something very

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,020
old can be come very new in a matter of minutes,

16
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:39,070
but it also means that you can start with conventional

17
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:42,010
tools, and end with technically impeccable

18
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:45,030
vector-based path outlines that you can refine,

19
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:47,040
and later scale to any size.

20
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:49,090
Near the end I'll show you how to trace a casual,

21
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:53,010
if preposterous, pencil sketch with open pass

22
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:55,020
and uniformly weighted strokes.

23
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:57,070
Then we'll wrap things up by tracing one of the most

24
00:00:57,070 --> 00:00:59,080
famous line drawings of all time,

25
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:03,020
Albrecht Durer's 16th century Rhinoceros.

26
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:05,070
The finished result is a combination of fills

27
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:09,000
and strokes that demonstrates in high resolution

28
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,020
detail why Durer's is in fact the original

29
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:14,020
preposterous rhinoceros.

30
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:17,080
Crazy classical artwork meets Space Age drawing program,

31
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:20,070
that's how we get the party started in the far-flung,

32
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:24,080
futuristic world of Illustrator One-on-One: Advanced.

33
01:59:58,000 --> 01:59:59:000
