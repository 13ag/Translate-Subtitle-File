1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:01,080
- [Voiceover] In this movie, I'll show you

2
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:04,020
how to customize the autotracing effect,

3
00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:07,050
specifically using an option known as threshold,

4
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:09,030
which is gonna allow us to preserve

5
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:12,050
some of the more fragile details in the original lineart.

6
00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:15,010
So I'm gonna go ahead and zoom in here,

7
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:17,030
and I'll click on the image to select it.

8
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:19,040
And then I'll go up here to the Options bar,

9
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:22,070
and there's this little icon that says Image Trace panel.

10
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:25,070
If you click on it, you'll bring up the panel like so.

11
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:28,010
You can also go to the Window menu, by the way,

12
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:30,030
and choose Image Trace if you like.

13
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:33,010
After all, you can get to all of the panels

14
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:35,030
in Illustrator from the Window menu.

15
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:37,020
I'm gonna go ahead and move this guy

16
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:39,050
off over to the side by dragging it

17
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:41,010
from the upper left corner,

18
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:43,090
so I don't accidentally drop it into the other panels.

19
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:46,030
Alright, now I want you to notice this View option.

20
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:48,070
Right now we're seeing the tracing results,

21
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:51,010
and that is, we're seeing the traced path outlines.

22
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:53,080
If you wanna see the outlines instead,

23
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:55,030
you can choose outlines

24
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:57,050
and that'll give you the cyan outlines,

25
00:00:57,050 --> 00:00:59,080
which are of some benefit, I suppose.

26
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:02,020
Or you can switch to the source image

27
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:05,000
so that you're seeing the original pixel-based image

28
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,090
as it appears before Illustrator traces it.

29
00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:10,000
Ideally, what you wanna be able to do

30
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,040
is compare the original image to the tracing result,

31
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,020
and the easiest way to do that

32
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:18,050
is to click and hold on this eye icon right there.

33
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:20,000
So if you click and hold, you'll see

34
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,060
the original pixel based image.

35
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:23,080
If you release, you'll see the tracing.

36
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:25,080
And what that's gonna help you decide is

37
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:28,040
how much of the image is missing

38
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:30,080
in the final traced result.

39
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:34,010
So for example, look at the lines inside my eye.

40
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:36,010
If I click and hold, they're a lot more clear.

41
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:38,030
We have some thin lines that are there

42
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:40,050
to indicate wrinkling, I suppose,

43
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:43,000
even though I was only in my twenties.

44
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,090
And then if I release, a lot of those lines disappear,

45
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:48,010
especially the ones inside Saturn.

46
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:50,050
And we can control exactly how that works

47
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:52,030
using this threshold option.

48
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:54,040
So here's the deal: if I was to

49
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:57,070
crank the threshold value all the way down to one,

50
00:01:57,070 --> 00:02:00,030
I'm saying the line has to be darker

51
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:04,020
than a luminance level of one in order to be traced,

52
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:06,050
which means that we're not tracing anything

53
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:08,050
inside this image whatsoever.

54
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:13,020
Because zero is black, one is extremely dark.

55
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:15,050
If I were to crank this value all the way up

56
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:18,030
to its maximum of 255, which is white,

57
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:21,060
then I'm saying trace everything because after all,

58
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:24,070
everything is at least white inside of this image.

59
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:26,050
So those are your two extremes,

60
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:29,000
what you wanna do is experiment with this value.

61
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,070
By default, it's set to 128, if I can get it there,

62
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:35,060
which is medium grays, so we're just basically

63
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:38,020
tracing the darkest half of the image

64
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:40,090
and leaving the whitest half untraced.

65
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:43,040
If you find that you're tracing too much of the image,

66
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,040
so you're tracing too many lines

67
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,010
and you're tracing a bunch of noise, for example,

68
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:50,050
in the image, then you wanna reduce this value.

69
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:53,040
In my case, we've gotta take it up to about 80,

70
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,090
now it's 81, in order to trace much of anything,

71
00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:59,000
as we're seeing right here.

72
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,070
But I obviously wanna trace

73
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:02,060
much more of the image than this,

74
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:04,080
so I'm gonna crank this value up.

75
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,010
And I ultimately came up with a value,

76
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:09,030
if I can hit it here, of 180.

77
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:12,070
And notice, every single time I modify this value,

78
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:15,090
I'm previewing the effect inside the document window

79
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:18,070
because I have the preview checkbox turned on.

80
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:20,050
If you don't want that to happen,

81
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:22,080
if you wanna be able to modify a value

82
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,070
without these constant previews,

83
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:26,030
which do slow things down,

84
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:28,080
then just go ahead and turn the preview checkbox off

85
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,000
and then modify the value as desired

86
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,090
and turn on the preview checkbox

87
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:36,030
in order to see the results update on-screen.

88
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:38,050
Now in my mind that's a little too much,

89
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:40,050
so as I was saying I'm gonna go ahead

90
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:42,080
and take my value down to 180,

91
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:45,020
at which point I get a pretty good mix

92
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:46,090
because what ends up happening

93
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:48,090
if I go too high with this value

94
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:51,020
is the text starts filling in,

95
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:53,040
and so does my signature down here

96
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,030
in the bottom right hand corner.

97
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:57,000
And so, as I say, you can experiment

98
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,090
with this value as much as you'd like,

99
00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:01,080
and you can get a lot of good results out of it.

100
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:04,030
So just so we can see how far we've come here,

101
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:06,010
I'll go ahead and reduce that value

102
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:08,050
back to 128, at which point I will of course

103
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:11,060
have to wait for the modifications to occur on-screen.

104
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:14,060
You can see that we were missing a lot of lines

105
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:16,030
at the beginning of this movie,

106
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:19,050
but if I now press Control-Z, or Command-Z on the Mac,

107
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:21,070
to undo that change, which by the way

108
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:24,090
forces Illustrator to perform a recalculation,

109
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:26,070
you can now see that we've got some

110
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:30,090
really good detail out of this autotraced effect.

111
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:33,050
And that's how you control the amount of detail

112
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:36,050
that Illustrator traces using the threshold value

113
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:38,060
in the Image Trace panel.

114
01:59:58,000 --> 01:59:59:000
