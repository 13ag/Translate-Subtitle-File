00:00:05.259 --> 00:00:10.840
When will your idea transform from a casual
side-hustle into a full-blown business?

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:15.359
Is it when your podcast gets sponsorships,
when your catering company is booked for 5

00:00:15.359 --> 00:00:19.260
weekends straight, or when you’ve sold your
100th bottle of Slug-be-Gone?

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.270
Basically, when do things get REAL?

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:26.369
I can’t tell you when you’ll start to
feel like a businessperson, but the world

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.590
recognizes it when you legally register your
formal business structure.

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:31.590
You could be an LLC.

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:32.590
Or a C-Corp.

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:33.820
Or a B-Corp.

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:34.820
Or a Co-op.

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:36.600
So many different letters!

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:42.059
It can be daunting to move from the abstract
idea stage to the realm of bank accounts,

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:43.639
taxes, and liability.

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:48.219
Sometimes, it can feel like you’re making
arbitrary decisions, but we’re going to

00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:50.870
wade through the legalese together.

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:52.170
Things are about to get legit.

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.420
I’m Anna Akana and this is Crash Course
Business: Entrepreneurship.

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:04.980
[Theme Music Plays]

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:10.010
The legal basics of entrepreneurship aren’t
as flashy as generating ideas or staking out

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:11.360
the competition.

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:15.760
But think about them like a Choose Your Own
Adventure novel.

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:20.930
Choosing a business structure opens up a different
future with unique twists and turns.

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:22.080
So buckle up.

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.820
Legally, you have to register your business.

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:29.690
And depending on where you live, your government
might have certain requirements to do that.

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:34.700
In the U.S., you register to say a cordial
“what’s up?” to the state and federal

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:35.700
government.

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:41.060
They need to know you exist so you can get
the licenses and permits you need to do business

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:43.900
and -- everyone’s favorite topic -- pay
your taxes.

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:47.890
For you as the owner, and anyone you’re
doing business with, registering can create

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:49.990
some legal and financial protection.

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:54.320
Specifically, we’re talking about liability
-- or the state of being legally responsible

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.500
for something -- and potentially using helpful
tax structures.

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.360
We’ll talk about a bit of money stuff here,
but check with your government’s commerce,

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.000
tax, or treasury departments for more details.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.920
There are lots of different options to pick
from when you register your business, so it’s

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.580
time to choose a path.

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:13.200
These are most of the U.S. options, but a
lot of countries have similar structures.

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.200
Let’s jump in.

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:20.530
A sole proprietorship is a type of business
that’s owned and run by one person.

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:24.109
Think freelance writers, independent landscapers,
or even YouTubers.

00:02:24.109 --> 00:02:29.569
This is the easiest Choose Your Own Adventure
decision: choosing nothing.

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:34.260
If you provide a service or product to someone
by yourself and get paid without registering

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.920
for any kind of business, you’re considered
a sole proprietorship.

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.879
But it has some drawbacks.

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:44.590
You aren’t considered separate from your
business -- you’re personally liable.

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:49.060
That means your business money isn’t separate
from your personal assets like your money,

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:53.939
car, or house -- and your personal assets
could be taken in a lawsuit.

00:02:53.939 --> 00:02:54.939
Yikes.

00:02:54.939 --> 00:02:59.099
Raising investment money can be tough because
you can’t sell stock -- or shares of ownership

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:00.099
in the company.

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:04.249
And banks might hesitate to lend money because
they perceive a bigger risk in lending to

00:03:04.249 --> 00:03:05.650
just one person.

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:08.499
Filing taxes as a sole proprietor is pretty
easy.

00:03:08.499 --> 00:03:12.299
You have what’s called pass-through status,
where profits are passed straight to business

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:17.010
owners and are just part of personal taxes,
instead of also being included in the business

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:18.010
taxes.

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:21.161
Basically, since the business money isn’t
separate from your personal money, you just

00:03:21.161 --> 00:03:23.069
submit once with a few extra forms.

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:27.999
Also, you have to factor in self-employment
taxes, which are explained on IRS.gov.

00:03:27.999 --> 00:03:32.150
The cool thing about a sole-proprietorship
is that your business expenses can be tax

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:33.150
write-offs!

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:34.150
New computer for work?

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:35.150
Write it off!

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:36.150
New desk?

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:37.150
Write it off!

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:41.060
You want to check with an accountant, of course,
but that is a real advantage of owning your

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:42.060
own business.

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:46.750
A partnership is a way for two or more people
to share ownership of a business, which is

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:51.180
great if you don’t want to go it alone,
or for professional groups like attorneys

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:52.489
or dentists.

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:53.832
All the fun groups.

00:03:53.832 --> 00:03:58.569
If you choose a partnership, you have to pick
one of three flavors that mostly affect power

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:02.909
and liability: General, Limited, and Limited
Liability.

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:08.439
In a General Partnership, you and one or more
partners share personal liability and all

00:04:08.439 --> 00:04:11.379
have an equal say when making decisions.

00:04:11.379 --> 00:04:15.680
Just like a sole proprietorship, it’s the
easiest choice for partners, but personal

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:17.190
liability can be risky.

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:23.160
In a Limited Partnership, someone takes on
unlimited liability, so their personal assets

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:27.670
can be seized in a legal battle, and they
have to pay self-employment taxes.

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:32.060
But they’re the head honcho and own and
run most of the business.

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:35.470
The other partners have limited input, but
also limited liability.

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:39.590
They’re only responsible for a slice of
the business assets so they’re personally

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:41.490
protected from lawsuits.

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:45.620
These are often silent business partners...
who are basically just the money.

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:46.620
Shhh!

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:51.270
In a Limited Liability Partnership, or LLP,
everyone gets limited liability.

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:56.700
It’s more work to form than a general partnership,
and gives less protection than fancier business

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:57.910
structures.

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:01.550
But it does give owners at least SOME liability
protection.

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:05.930
No matter the flavor, you’ll have an easier
time raising money in a partnership than alone,

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:08.810
since banks might be more willing to lend
to multiple people.

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:12.730
And you could get investments if you’re
willing to take on silent partners.

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:15.530
Partnerships are also helpful for tax reasons.

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:20.190
General partners have pass-through status
for taxes, like a sole proprietorship.

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:24.090
Everyone splits the profits through the business,
and deals with their own taxes, including

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:25.820
self-employment taxes.

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:31.450
Overall, partnerships -- especially LPs and
LLPs -- are more expensive than sole proprietorships

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:33.730
because they need more legal and accounting
help.

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:39.230
Now a corporation, sometimes called a C-corp,
is an entity that’s completely separate

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:40.460
from its owners.

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:45.260
Like a person, a corporation can have profits,
taxes, and liability.

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:49.650
The BBC, eBay, and AirBnB are all corporations.

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:52.121
Where you incorporate matters for many legal
reasons.

00:05:52.121 --> 00:05:57.250
In the U.S., for example, lots of people form
their legal entity in Delaware.

00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:01.750
If you choose the C-corp path, you’re protected
from lawsuits -- you aren’t personally liable

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:03.950
and have limited liability.

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:08.420
Funding is also easier, because corporations
can sell stock to the public.

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:12.190
While corporations can borrow from banks,
they typically find it too restrictive and

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:13.640
find money other ways.

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:18.940
Plus, if stockholders -- the people who own
shares of your business -- leave or sell their

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:22.810
stocks, you can keep chugging along instead
of stopping to restructure.

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:26.509
But for all these benefits, you have to be
ready to hustle.

00:06:26.509 --> 00:06:31.670
Any type of corporation needs a giant pile
of state and federal paperwork to form.

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:38.350
They require extensive record-keeping, operational
processes, and annual reports on their activities

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:39.400
to the government.

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:42.160
C-corps are also expensive to form.

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:47.440
And unlike sole proprietors and partnerships,
C-corps pay tax on profits before handing

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:52.050
money out to stockholders, who also have to
pay their own taxes, which means a little

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:54.000
less profit for each owner.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.710
C-corps are also beholden to profit.

00:06:56.710 --> 00:07:01.240
Their decisions have to be based on what makes
the most profit for stockholders.

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:06.550
A benefit corporation, sometimes known as
a B-corp, focuses on social good.

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:11.300
Patagonia, Ben &amp; Jerry’s, TOMS, and The
Honest Company follow this path!

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:15.990
Like any corporation, B-corps give you lots
of protection with limited liability.

00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:20.680
And maybe more importantly, this structure
empowers and protects you to make a difference

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:22.280
and a profit.

00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:26.360
B-corps are designed to let the CEO -- the
person in charge of the business who may or

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:30.340
may not be an owner -- make decisions for
social good.

00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:35.330
Even if those decisions are a little less
profitable, the CEO won’t get in trouble

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:36.400
with stockholders.

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:39.840
The funding and structure is similar to a
C-corp.

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:44.920
But you can also look for impact investing
-- people investing money to create a specific

00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:47.240
social or environmental benefit.

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:52.180
It’s still really expensive to incorporate,
and B-corps are taxed the same as C-corps.

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:58.630
Plus, to make sure you’re doing social good,
you have to create even more reports for transparency.

00:07:58.630 --> 00:08:01.560
Get ready for mountains of paperwork!

00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:06.790
A limited liability company, or LLC, is sort
of a corporation-partnership hybrid.

00:08:06.790 --> 00:08:08.889
LLCs can have one or more owners.

00:08:08.889 --> 00:08:11.660
Complexly is an LLC!

00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:15.010
It’s literally in the name: you have limited
liability.

00:08:15.010 --> 00:08:20.580
Plus, you can still choose to become a corporation
later if you want -- that path is still open.

00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:24.650
Many startups begin with an LLC because of
the protection and flexibility it has.

00:08:24.650 --> 00:08:27.640
In fact, this might help you attract investors.

00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:32.440
LLC stock is privately owned, so being able
to transform into a corporation and eventually

00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:35.530
sell stock to the public might draw in the
financiers.

00:08:35.530 --> 00:08:40.479
And like a partnership, you have pass-through
status for taxes, which can be nice, but you

00:08:40.479 --> 00:08:44.920
still pay self-employment taxes.

00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:49.890
One risk of choosing this path is when an
owner joins or leaves an LLC, you might be

00:08:49.890 --> 00:08:51.610
forced to reform.

00:08:51.610 --> 00:08:55.860
But you can also create a legal agreement
within an LLC to cover ownership transfers.

00:08:55.860 --> 00:09:00.940
A cooperative, or co-op, is a business owned
by the people using it -- like REI or a farming

00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:01.940
co-op.

00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:07.210
An elected board of directors runs the co-op,
while every stockholder-slash-owner can vote

00:09:07.210 --> 00:09:09.110
on the overall direction.

00:09:09.110 --> 00:09:11.200
So stockholders have a real voice!

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:15.710
The main problem is that the wheels of democracy
turn slowly.

00:09:15.710 --> 00:09:20.570
Stockholders vote on all decisions, which
means that responses to market changes are

00:09:20.570 --> 00:09:21.570
slower.

00:09:21.570 --> 00:09:25.900
But in the spirit of equality, each owner
gets precisely one vote and enjoys limited

00:09:25.900 --> 00:09:26.900
liability.

00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:32.700
You can generate money for a co-op by selling
stocks, and any profits are distributed among

00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:33.700
the stockholders.

00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:35.980
But you might have a hard time getting outside
investment.

00:09:35.980 --> 00:09:40.330
Traditional banks aren’t super excited about
lending to businesses where their money won’t

00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:43.700
be guaranteed by one or a few specific owners.

00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:48.730
And, like a corporation, co-ops have the “double
taxation” treatment for stockholders.

00:09:48.730 --> 00:09:56.580
And finally [at long last], a nonprofit corporation
is created to do charity, education, religious,

00:09:56.580 --> 00:10:00.970
literary, or scientific work that isn’t
taxed.

00:10:00.970 --> 00:10:04.620
Nonprofits include Amnesty International,
Better Business Bureau, or the Foundation

00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:06.180
to Decrease World Suck.

00:10:06.180 --> 00:10:08.810
If you choose this path, your work benefits
the public.

00:10:08.810 --> 00:10:14.470
So nonprofits have tons of paperwork and record-keeping,
operational processes, and must submit an

00:10:14.470 --> 00:10:17.990
annual report on their activities to the government,
similar to a C-corp.

00:10:17.990 --> 00:10:21.970
Also, owners are well-protected and have limited
liability.

00:10:21.970 --> 00:10:26.520
After jumping through some hoops with the
IRS, the government will grant you tax-exempt

00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:31.310
status, meaning you don’t pay state or federal
taxes on any profits.

00:10:31.310 --> 00:10:35.661
And there are strict rules on what to do with
any profits you earn -- like, you can't distribute

00:10:35.661 --> 00:10:38.070
them to stockholders or political campaigns.

00:10:38.070 --> 00:10:42.529
As for funding, nonprofits are often eligible
for grants -- or money given by a government

00:10:42.529 --> 00:10:45.340
or organization for a specific project.

00:10:45.340 --> 00:10:49.380
Other people and corporations can also just
give you money so that they can write it off

00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:50.700
on their taxes.

00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:54.000
And out of the goodness of their hearts, of
course.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:55.000
Phew.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:56.000
Got all that?

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.780
We made a handy chart for you too, just in
case!

00:10:58.780 --> 00:11:02.730
By choosing our business structure, we’re
also thinking about who we want to work with,

00:11:02.730 --> 00:11:04.490
and what future we see for our business.

00:11:04.490 --> 00:11:06.520
Let’s go to the Thought Bubble.

00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:10.400
You do a lot of tutoring online using free
video chat software.

00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:14.779
But you notice a gap in the market and want
to develop a long-distance tutoring business

00:11:14.779 --> 00:11:16.560
and potentially a new app.

00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:20.460
You decide against a business partner, because
you don’t want to share decision-making

00:11:20.460 --> 00:11:25.080
or profits with anyone, and you couldn’t
find a co-founder with skills that complement

00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:26.080
yours.

00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:30.320
But you can’t handle all this tutoring yourself,
so you plan to hire employees!

00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:34.340
You dig into the legal requirements for how
to pay them, and find some software to help

00:11:34.340 --> 00:11:37.029
you manage payroll, taxes, and more.

00:11:37.029 --> 00:11:41.790
It’s starting to look like a REAL business,
so it’s time to choose your own adventure.

00:11:41.790 --> 00:11:44.220
You might start out as a sole proprietorship.

00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:48.650
It’s just you and one employee, and you’re
not sure this is a super long-term endeavor.

00:11:48.650 --> 00:11:52.280
After a couple years, though, you decide to
become an LLC.

00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:57.339
You’re great at what you do, but some clients
get mean when their grades don’t skyrocket

00:11:57.339 --> 00:12:00.960
-- so you need protection from personal liability.

00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:03.690
And then… you’re at a crossroads.

00:12:03.690 --> 00:12:07.880
The future looks promising for generating
a tutoring app, but you’re having trouble

00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:09.240
getting investors.

00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:13.720
So you can stick with an LLC or try to transform
into a C-corp.

00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:18.440
Maybe you decide to stay an LLC, but you get
an unlucky dice roll while generating your

00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:19.440
app.

00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:23.380
You spread yourself too thin, and eventually
you can’t support all your tutors and developers.

00:12:23.380 --> 00:12:26.910
You eventually decide to cut your losses and
call it quits.

00:12:26.910 --> 00:12:27.940
You had a good run!

00:12:27.940 --> 00:12:33.210
Or maybe you decide to put in a lot of work
and incorporate, and luckily hit the jackpot:

00:12:33.210 --> 00:12:36.870
as your app grows, venture capitalists are
clamoring to invest.

00:12:36.870 --> 00:12:42.529
You’re quickly becoming the premier tutoring
organization in the U.S. and this business

00:12:42.529 --> 00:12:43.899
might outlive you.

00:12:43.899 --> 00:12:45.210
Thanks Thought Bubble!

00:12:45.210 --> 00:12:50.790
There really is no “best” structure because
every business is different, your path might

00:12:50.790 --> 00:12:56.410
change over time, and success involves grit,
determination, AND luck.

00:12:56.410 --> 00:13:01.990
We recommend talking to a trustworthy attorney
or tax accountant for specific and nuanced

00:13:01.990 --> 00:13:06.210
advice, since they’ll know your business
idea inside and out.

00:13:06.210 --> 00:13:09.880
Once we’ve chosen a legal structure, we
still have to say “what’s up?” to the

00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:12.240
government so they know we exist.

00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:13.870
And this means… paperwork.

00:13:13.870 --> 00:13:15.760
Let’s start with the feds.

00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:20.300
In the U.S., you need an Employer Identification
Number from the federal government, which

00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:22.980
will help you with taxes and getting a bank
account.

00:13:22.980 --> 00:13:27.170
If you open a branch of your business in the
Scottish Highlands or the Bolivian Salt Flats,

00:13:27.170 --> 00:13:29.940
you’ll need to look at what those countries
require.

00:13:29.940 --> 00:13:33.800
Next, register your business through your
Secretary of State’s website.

00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:37.980
There are often small filing fees, and if
that’s a barrier, try to find an advocate

00:13:37.980 --> 00:13:44.010
at a local Small Business Development Center,
bank, or your state’s Department of Commerce.

00:13:44.010 --> 00:13:47.340
Someone may know someone who knows a program
to get your fee waived.

00:13:47.340 --> 00:13:49.110
It never hurts to ask!

00:13:49.110 --> 00:13:50.800
The worst they can say is no, go away!

00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:53.480
Then, check in with your local government.

00:13:53.480 --> 00:13:58.200
Are there requirements to doing business in
your city, like a business license you need

00:13:58.200 --> 00:13:59.200
to get?

00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:02.580
And finally, it’s never too early to start
thinking about taxes!

00:14:02.580 --> 00:14:05.760
Review the requirements for your state and
federal tax reporting.

00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:11.140
You could use an accountant or DIY software
like TurboTax -- depending on your needs.

00:14:11.140 --> 00:14:12.140
Make a plan.

00:14:12.140 --> 00:14:13.470
Stick to the plan.

00:14:13.470 --> 00:14:15.390
File your taxes.

00:14:15.390 --> 00:14:20.700
So the bottom line is: registering your business
is a big decision, but an exciting one, because

00:14:20.700 --> 00:14:22.570
you get to define your own path.

00:14:22.570 --> 00:14:25.630
Where do you see your business going in 5
years?

00:14:25.630 --> 00:14:27.530
What does success look like?

00:14:27.530 --> 00:14:29.700
What infrastructure will you need?

00:14:29.700 --> 00:14:31.010
It’s up to you.

00:14:31.010 --> 00:14:35.000
Next time, we’ll talk about how to get feedback
before launching our business, and what to

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:36.930
do if our idea is falling flat.

00:14:36.930 --> 00:14:40.740
